ABBREVIATION.
Synonyms:
abridgment, contraction.
An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of
the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the
first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made either by omitting certain portions from the
interior or by cutting off a part; a contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a
contraction; rec't for receipt, mdse. for merchandise, and Dr. for debtor are contractions; they are also
abbreviations; Am. for American is an abbreviation, but not a contraction. Abbreviation and contraction are
used of words and phrases, abridgment of books, paragraphs, sentences, etc. Compare ABRIDGMENT.

ABET.
Synonyms:
advocate, countenance, incite, sanction, aid, embolden, instigate, support, assist, encourage, promote, uphold.
Abet and instigate are now used almost without exception in a bad sense; one may incite either to good or evil.
One incites or instigates to the doing of something not yet done, or to increased activity or further advance in
the doing of it; one abets by giving sympathy, countenance, or substantial aid to the doing of that which is
already projected or in process of commission. Abet and instigate apply either to persons or actions, incite to
persons only; one incites a person to an action. A clergyman will advocate the claims of justice, aid the poor,
10
encourage the despondent, support the weak, uphold the constituted authorities; but he will not incite to a
quarrel, instigate a riot, or abet a crime. The originator of a crime often instigates or incites others to abet him
in it, or one may instigate or incite others to a crime in the commission of which he himself takes no active
part. Compare HELP.
Antonyms:
baffle, deter, dissuade, hinder, confound, disapprove, expose, impede, counteract, disconcert, frustrate,
obstruct. denounce, discourage,
* * * * *
ABHOR.
Synonyms:
abominate, dislike, loathe, scorn, despise, hate, nauseate, shun. detest,
Abhor is stronger than despise, implying a shuddering recoil, especially a moral recoil. "How many shun evil
as inconvenient who do not abhor it as hateful." TRENCH Serm. in Westm. Abbey xxvi, 297. [M.] Detest
expresses indignation, with something of contempt. Loathe implies disgust, physical or moral. We abhor a
traitor, despise a coward, detest a liar. We dislike an uncivil person. We abhor cruelty, hate tyranny. We
loathe a reptile or a flatterer. We abhor Milton's heroic Satan, but we can not despise him.
Antonyms:
admire, crave, esteem, love, approve, desire, like, relish. covet, enjoy,
* * * * *
ABIDE.
Synonyms:
anticipate, dwell, remain, stop, await, endure, reside, tarry, bear, expect, rest, tolerate, bide, inhabit, sojourn,
wait, confront, live, stay, watch. continue, lodge,
To abide is to remain continuously without limit of time unless expressed by the context: "to-day I must abide
at thy house," Luke xix, 5; "a settled place for thee to abide in forever," 1 Kings viii, 13; "Abide with me! fast
falls the eventide," LYTE Hymn. Lodge, sojourn, stay, tarry, and wait always imply a limited time; lodge, to
pass the night; sojourn, to remain temporarily; live, dwell, reside, to have a permanent home. Stop, in the
sense of stay or sojourn, is colloquial, and not in approved use. Compare ENDURE; REST.
Antonyms:
abandon, forfeit, migrate, reject, avoid, forfend, move, resist, depart, journey, proceed, shun.
Prepositions:
Abide in a place, for a time, with a person, by a statement.

ABOLISH.
Synonyms:
abate, eradicate, prohibit, stamp out, abrogate, exterminate, remove, subvert, annihilate, extirpate, repeal,
supplant, annul, nullify, reverse, suppress, destroy, obliterate, revoke, terminate. end, overthrow, set aside,
Abolish, to do away with, bring absolutely to an end, especially as something hostile, hindering, or harmful,
was formerly used of persons and material objects, a usage now obsolete except in poetry or highly figurative
speech. Abolish is now used of institutions, customs, and conditions, especially those wide-spread and long
existing; as, to abolish slavery, ignorance, intemperance, poverty. A building that is burned to the ground is
said to be destroyed by fire. Annihilate, as a philosophical term, signifies to put absolutely out of existence.
As far as our knowledge goes, matter is never annihilated, but only changes its form. Some believe that the
wicked will be annihilated. Abolish is not said of laws. There we use repeal, abrogate, nullify, etc.: repeal by
the enacting body, nullify by revolutionary proceedings; a later statute abrogates, without formally repealing,
any earlier law with which it conflicts. An appellate court may reverse or set aside the decision of an inferior
court. Overthrow may be used in either a good or a bad sense; suppress is commonly in a good, subvert
always in a bad sense; as, to subvert our liberties; to suppress a rebellion. The law prohibits what may never
have existed; it abolishes an existing evil. We abate a nuisance, terminate a controversy. Compare CANCEL;
DEMOLISH; EXTERMINATE.
Antonyms:
authorize, establish, reinstate, revive, cherish, institute, renew, set up, confirm, introduce, repair, support,
continue, legalize, restore, sustain. enact, promote,
* * * * *
ABOMINATION.
Synonyms:
abhorrence, curse, hatred, plague, abuse, detestation, horror, shame, annoyance, disgust, iniquity, villainy,
aversion, evil, nuisance, wickedness. crime, execration, offense,
Abomination (from the L. ab omen, a thing of ill omen) was originally applied to anything held in religious or
ceremonial aversion or abhorrence; as, "The things which are highly esteemed among men are abomination
in the sight of God." Luke xvi, 15. The word is oftener applied to the object of such aversion or abhorrence
than to the state of mind that so regards it; in common use abomination signifies something very much
disliked or loathed, or that deserves to be. Choice food may be an object of aversion and disgust to a sick
person; vile food would be an abomination. A toad is to many an object of disgust; a foul sewer is an
abomination. As applied to crimes, abomination is used of such as are especially brutal, shameful, or
revolting; theft is an offense; infanticide is an abomination.
Antonyms:
affection, blessing, enjoyment, joy, appreciation, delight, esteem, satisfaction, approval, desire, gratification,
treat. benefit,
* * * * *
ABRIDGMENT.
12
Synonyms:
abbreviation, compend, epitome, summary, abstract, compendium, outline, synopsis. analysis, digest,
An abridgment gives the most important portions of a work substantially as they stand. An outline or synopsis
is a kind of sketch closely following the plan. An abstract or digest is an independent statement of what the
book contains. An analysis draws out the chief thoughts or arguments, whether expressed or implied. A
summary is the most condensed statement of results or conclusions. An epitome, compend, or compendium is
a condensed view of a subject, whether derived from a previous publication or not. We may have an
abridgment of a dictionary, but not an analysis, abstract, digest, or summary. We may have an epitome of
religion, a compendium of English literature, but not an abridgment. Compare ABBREVIATION.
* * * * *
ABSOLUTE.
Synonyms:
arbitrary, compulsory, haughty, peremptory, arrogant, controlling, imperative, positive, authoritative,
despotic, imperious, supreme, autocratic, dictatorial, irresponsible, tyrannical, coercive, dogmatic, lordly,
unconditional, commanding, domineering, overbearing, unequivocal. compulsive, exacting,
In the strict sense, absolute, free from all limitation or control, and supreme, superior to all, can not properly
be said of any being except the divine. Both words are used, however, in a modified sense, of human
authorities; absolute then signifying free from limitation by other authority, and supreme exalted over all
other; as, an absolute monarch, the supreme court. Absolute, in this use, does not necessarily carry any
unfavorable sense, but as absolute power in human hands is always abused, the unfavorable meaning
predominates. Autocratic power knows no limits outside the ruler's self; arbitrary power, none outside the
ruler's will or judgment, arbitrary carrying the implication of wilfulness and capriciousness. Despotic is
commonly applied to a masterful or severe use of power, which is expressed more decidedly by tyrannical.
Arbitrary may be used in a good sense; as, the pronunciation of proper names is arbitrary; but the bad sense is
the prevailing one; as, an arbitrary proceeding. Irresponsible power is not necessarily bad, but eminently
dangerous; an executor or trustee should not be irresponsible; an irresponsible ruler is likely to be tyrannical.
A perfect ruler might be irresponsible and not tyrannical. Authoritative is used always in a good sense,
implying the right to claim authority; imperative, peremptory, and positive are used ordinarily in the good
sense; as, an authoritative definition; an imperative demand; a peremptory command; positive instructions;
imperious signifies assuming and determined to command, rigorously requiring obedience. An imperious
demand or requirement may have in it nothing offensive; it is simply one that resolutely insists upon
compliance, and will not brook refusal; an arrogant demand is offensive by its tone of superiority, an
arbitrary demand by its unreasonableness; an imperious disposition is liable to become arbitrary and
arrogant. A person of an independent spirit is inclined to resent an imperious manner in any one, especially in
one whose superiority is not clearly recognized. Commanding is always used in a good sense; as, a
commanding appearance; a commanding eminence. Compare DOGMATIC; INFINITE; PERFECT.
Antonyms:
accountable, constitutional, gentle, lowly, responsible, complaisant, contingent, humble, meek, submissive,
compliant, docile, lenient, mild, yielding. conditional, ductile, limited,
* * * * *
ABSOLVE.
13
Synonyms:
acquit, exculpate, forgive, pardon, clear, exempt, free, release, discharge, exonerate, liberate, set free.
To absolve, in the strict sense, is to set free from any bond. One may be absolved from a promise by a breach
of faith on the part of one to whom the promise was made. To absolve from sins is formally to remit their
condemnation and penalty, regarded as a bond upon the soul. "Almighty God ... pardoneth and absolveth all
those who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel." Book of Common Prayer, Declar. of Absol.
To acquit of sin or crime is to free from the accusation of it, pronouncing one guiltless; the innocent are
rightfully acquitted; the guilty may be mercifully absolved. Compare PARDON.
Antonyms:
accuse, charge, condemn, impeach, obligate, bind, compel, convict, inculpate, oblige.
Preposition:
One is absolved from (rarely of) a promise, a sin, etc.
* * * * *
ABSORB.
Synonyms:
consume, engross, suck up, take in, drink in, exhaust, swallow, take up. drink up, imbibe, swallow up,
A fluid that is absorbed is taken up into the mass of the absorbing body, with which it may or may not
permanently combine. Wood expands when it absorbs moisture, iron when it absorbs heat, the substance
remaining perhaps otherwise substantially unchanged; quicklime, when it absorbs water, becomes a new
substance with different qualities, hydrated or slaked lime. A substance is consumed which is destructively
appropriated by some other substance, being, or agency, so that it ceases to exist or to be recognized as
existing in its original condition; fuel is consumed in the fire, food in the body; consume is also applied to
whatever is removed from the market for individual use; as, silk and woolen goods are consumed. A great
talker engrosses the conversation. A credulous person swallows the most preposterous statement. A busy
student imbibes or drinks in knowledge; he is absorbed in a subject that takes his whole attention. "I only
postponed it because I happened to get absorbed in a book." KANE Grinnell Exped. ch. 43, page 403. [H.
'54.]
Antonyms:
cast out, dissipate, emit, put forth, shoot forth, disgorge, distract, exude, radiate, throw off, disperse, eject,
give up, send out, vomit.
Prepositions:
Plants absorb moisture from the air; the student is absorbed in thought; nutriment may be absorbed into the
system through the skin.
* * * * *
ABSTINENCE.
14
Synonyms:
abstemiousness, frugality, self-denial, sobriety, continence, moderation, self-restraint, temperance. fasting,
self-control,
Abstinence from food commonly signifies going without; abstemiousness, partaking moderately; abstinence
may be for a single occasion, abstemiousness is habitual moderation. Self-denial is giving up what one
wishes; abstinence may be refraining from what one does not desire. Fasting is abstinence from food for a
limited time, and generally for religious reasons. Sobriety and temperance signify maintaining a quiet, even
temper by moderate indulgence in some things, complete abstinence from others. We speak of temperance in
eating, but of abstinence from vice. Total abstinence has come to signify the entire abstaining from
intoxicating liquors.
Antonyms:
drunkenness, greed, reveling, sensuality, excess, intemperance, revelry, wantonness. gluttony, intoxication,
self-indulgence,
Preposition:
The negative side of virtue is abstinence from vice.
* * * * *
ABSTRACT, v.
Synonyms:
appropriate, distract, purloin, steal, detach, divert, remove, take away, discriminate, eliminate, separate,
withdraw. distinguish,
The central idea of withdrawing makes abstract in common speech a euphemism for appropriate
(unlawfully), purloin, steal. In mental processes we discriminate between objects by distinguishing their
differences; we separate some one element from all that does not necessarily belong to it, abstract it, and
view it alone. We may separate two ideas, and hold both in mind in comparison or contrast; but when we
abstract one of them, we drop the other out of thought. The mind is abstracted when it is withdrawn from all
other subjects and concentrated upon one, diverted when it is drawn away from what it would or should attend
to by some other interest, distracted when the attention is divided among different subjects, so that it can not
be given properly to any. The trouble with the distracted person is that he is not abstracted. Compare
DISCERN.
Antonyms:
add, complete, fill up, restore, unite. combine, conjoin, increase, strengthen,
Prepositions:
The purse may be abstracted from the pocket; the substance from the accidents; a book into a compend.
* * * * *
ABSTRACTED.
15
Synonyms:
absent, heedless, listless, preoccupied, absent-minded, inattentive, negligent, thoughtless. absorbed,
indifferent, oblivious,
As regards mental action, absorbed, abstracted, and preoccupied refer to the cause, absent or absent-minded
to the effect. The man absorbed in one thing will appear absent in others. A preoccupied person may seem
listless and thoughtless, but the really listless and thoughtless have not mental energy to be preoccupied. The
absent-minded man is oblivious of ordinary matters, because his thoughts are elsewhere. One who is
preoccupied is intensely busy in thought; one may be absent-minded either through intense concentration or
simply through inattention, with fitful and aimless wandering of thought. Compare ABSTRACT.
Antonyms:
alert, on hand, ready, wide-awake. attentive, prompt, thoughtful,
* * * * *
ABSURD.
Synonyms:
anomalous, ill-considered, ludicrous, ridiculous, chimerical, ill-judged, mistaken, senseless, erroneous,
inconclusive, monstrous, stupid, false, incorrect, nonsensical, unreasonable, foolish, infatuated, paradoxical,
wild. ill-advised, irrational, preposterous,
That is absurd which is contrary to the first principles of reasoning; as, that a part should be greater than the
whole is absurd. A paradoxical statement appears at first thought contradictory or absurd, while it may be
really true. Anything is irrational when clearly contrary to sound reason, foolish when contrary to practical
good sense, silly when petty and contemptible in its folly, erroneous when containing error that vitiates the
result, unreasonable when there seems a perverse bias or an intent to go wrong. Monstrous and preposterous
refer to what is overwhelmingly absurd; as, "O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two,"
SHAKESPEARE 1 King Henry IV, act ii, sc. 4. The ridiculous or the nonsensical is worthy only to be
laughed at. The lunatic's claim to be a king is ridiculous; the Mother Goose rimes are nonsensical. Compare
INCONGRUOUS.
Antonyms:
certain, incontrovertible, rational, substantial, consistent, indisputable, reasonable, true, demonstrable,
indubitable, sagacious, undeniable, demonstrated, infallible, sensible, unquestionable, established, logical,
sound, wise. incontestable,
* * * * *
ABUSE.
Synonyms:
aggrieve, impose on or oppress, ruin, damage, upon, persecute, slander, defame, injure, pervert, victimize,
defile, malign, prostitute, vilify, disparage, maltreat, rail at, violate, harm, misemploy, ravish, vituperate,
ill-treat, misuse, reproach, wrong. ill-use, molest, revile,
16
Abuse covers all unreasonable or improper use or treatment by word or act. A tenant does not abuse rented
property by "reasonable wear," though that may damage the property and injure its sale; he may abuse it by
needless defacement or neglect. It is possible to abuse a man without harming him, as when the criminal
vituperates the judge; or to harm a man without abusing him, as when the witness tells the truth about the
criminal. Defame, malign, rail at, revile, slander, vilify, and vituperate are used always in a bad sense. One
may be justly reproached. To impose on or to victimize one is to injure him by abusing his confidence. To
persecute one is to ill-treat him for opinion's sake, commonly for religious belief; to oppress is generally for
political or pecuniary motives. "Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy," Deut. xxiv,
14. Misemploy, misuse, and pervert are commonly applied to objects rather than to persons. A dissolute youth
misemploys his time, misuses his money and opportunities, harms his associates, perverts his talents, wrongs
his parents, ruins himself, abuses every good gift of God.
Antonyms:
applaud, conserve, favor, protect, sustain, benefit, consider, laud, regard, tend, care for, eulogize, panegyrize,
respect, uphold, cherish, extol, praise, shield, vindicate.

ACCESSORY.
Synonyms:
abetter or abettor, associate, companion, henchman, accomplice, attendant, confederate, participator, ally,
coadjutor, follower, partner, assistant, colleague, helper, retainer.
Colleague is used always in a good sense, associate and coadjutor generally so; ally, assistant, associate,
attendant, companion, helper, either in a good or a bad sense; abetter, accessory, accomplice, confederate,
almost always in a bad sense. Ally is oftenest used of national and military matters, or of some other
connection regarded as great and important; as, allies of despotism. Colleague is applied to civil and
ecclesiastical connections; members of Congress from the same State are colleagues, even though they may
be bitter opponents politically and personally. An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court is near in rank to the
Chief Justice. A surgeon's assistant is a physician or medical student who shares in the treatment and care of
patients; a surgeon's attendant is one who rolls bandages and the like. Follower, henchman, retainer are
persons especially devoted to a chief, and generally bound to him by necessity, fee, or reward. Partner has
come to denote almost exclusively a business connection. In law, an abettor (the general legal spelling) is
always present, either actively or constructively, at the commission of the crime; an accessory never. An
accomplice is usually a principal; an accessory never. If present, though only to stand outside and keep watch
against surprise, one is an abettor, and not an accessory. At common law, an accessory implies a principal,
and can not be convicted until after the conviction of the principal; the accomplice or abettor can be convicted
as a principal. Accomplice and abettor have nearly the same meaning, but the former is the popular, the latter
more distinctively the legal term. Compare APPENDAGE; AUXILIARY.
Antonyms:
adversary, chief, foe, leader, principal, antagonist, commander, hinderer, opponent, rival. betrayer, enemy,
instigator, opposer,
Prepositions:
An accessory to the crime; before or after the fact; the accessories of a figure in a painting.

ACCIDENT.
Synonyms:
adventure, contingency, happening, misfortune, calamity, disaster, hazard, mishap, casualty, fortuity, incident,
possibility. chance, hap, misadventure,
An accident is that which happens without any one's direct intention; a chance that which happens without
any known cause. If the direct cause of a railroad accident is known, we can not call it a chance. To the theist
there is, in strictness, no chance, all things being by divine causation and control; but chance is spoken of
where no special cause is manifest: "By chance there came down a certain priest that way," Luke x, 31. We
can speak of a game of chance, but not of a game of accident. An incident is viewed as occurring in the
regular course of things, but subordinate to the main purpose, or aside from the main design. Fortune is the
result of inscrutable controlling forces. Fortune and chance are nearly equivalent, but chance can be used of
human effort and endeavor as fortune can not be; we say "he has a chance of success," or "there is one chance
in a thousand," where we could not substitute fortune; as personified, Fortune is regarded as having a fitful
purpose, Chance as purposeless; we speak of fickle Fortune, blind Chance; "Fortune favors the brave." The
slaughter of men is an incident of battle; unexpected defeat, the fortune of war. Since the unintended is often
the undesirable, accident tends to signify some calamity or disaster, unless the contrary is expressed, as when
we say a fortunate or happy accident. An adventure is that which may turn out ill, a misadventure that which
does turn out ill. A slight disturbing accident is a mishap. Compare EVENT; HAZARD.
Antonyms:
appointment, decree, intention, ordainment, preparation, calculation, fate, law, ordinance, provision, certainty,
foreordination, necessity, plan, purpose.
Prepositions:
The accident of birth; an accident to the machinery.
* * * * *
ACQUAINTANCE.
Synonyms:
association, experience, fellowship, intimacy, companionship, familiarity, friendship, knowledge.
Acquaintance between persons supposes that each knows the other; we may know a public man by his
writings or speeches, and by sight, but can not claim acquaintance unless he personally knows us. There may
be pleasant acquaintance with little companionship; and conversely, much companionship with little
acquaintance, as between busy clerks at adjoining desks. So there may be association in business without
intimacy or friendship. Acquaintance admits of many degrees, from a slight or passing to a familiar or
intimate acquaintance; but acquaintance unmodified commonly signifies less than familiarity or intimacy. As
regards persons, familiarity is becoming restricted to the undesirable sense, as in the proverb, "Familiarity
breeds contempt;" hence, in personal relations, the word intimacy, which refers to mutual knowledge of
thought and feeling, is now uniformly preferred. Friendship includes acquaintance with some degree of
intimacy, and ordinarily companionship, though in a wider sense friendship may exist between those who
have never met, but know each other only by word and deed. Acquaintance does not involve friendship, for
18
one may be well acquainted with an enemy. Fellowship involves not merely acquaintance and
companionship, but sympathy as well. There may be much friendship without much fellowship, as between
those whose homes or pursuits are far apart. There may be pleasant fellowship which does not reach the
fulness of friendship. Compare ATTACHMENT; FRIENDSHIP; LOVE. As regards studies, pursuits, etc.,
acquaintance is less than familiarity, which supposes minute knowledge of particulars, arising often from long
experience or association.
Antonyms:
ignorance, ignoring, inexperience, unfamiliarity.
Prepositions:
Acquaintance with a subject; of one person with another; between persons.
* * * * *
ACRIMONY.
Synonyms:
acerbity, harshness, severity, tartness, asperity, malignity, sharpness, unkindness, bitterness, moroseness,
sourness, virulence. causticity,
Acerbity is a sharpness, with a touch of bitterness, which may arise from momentary annoyance or habitual
impatience; asperity is keener and more pronounced, denoting distinct irritation or vexation; in speech
asperity is often manifested by the tone of voice rather than by the words that are spoken. Acrimony in speech
or temper is like a corrosive acid; it springs from settled character or deeply rooted feeling of aversion or
unkindness. One might speak with momentary asperity to his child, but not with acrimony, unless
estrangement had begun. Malignity is the extreme of settled ill intent; virulence is an envenomed hostility.
Virulence of speech is a quality in language that makes the language seem as if exuding poison. Virulence is
outspoken; malignity may be covered with smooth and courteous phrase. We say intense virulence, deep
malignity. Severity is always painful, and may be terrible, but carries ordinarily the implication, true or false,
of justice. Compare ANGER; BITTER; ENMITY.
Antonyms:
amiability, gentleness, kindness, smoothness, courtesy, good nature, mildness, sweetness.
* * * * *
ACT, n.
Synonyms:
accomplishment, execution, movement, achievement, exercise, operation, action, exertion, performance,
consummation, exploit, proceeding, deed, feat, transaction, doing, motion, work. effect,
An act is strictly and originally something accomplished by an exercise of power, in which sense it is
synonymous with deed or effect. Action is a doing. Act is therefore single, individual, momentary; action a
complex of acts, or a process, state, or habit of exerting power. We say a virtuous act, but rather a virtuous
course of action. We speak of the action of an acid upon a metal, not of its act. Act is used, also, for the
19
simple exertion of power; as, an act of will. In this sense an act does not necessarily imply an external effect,
while an action does. Morally, the act of murder is in the determination to kill; legally, the act is not complete
without the striking of the fatal blow. Act and deed are both used for the thing done, but act refers to the
power put forth, deed to the result accomplished; as, a voluntary act, a bad deed. In connection with other
words act is more usually qualified by the use of another noun, action by an adjective preceding; we may say
a kind act, though oftener an act of kindness, but only a kind action, not an action of kindness. As between
act and deed, deed is commonly used of great, notable, and impressive acts, as are achievement, exploit, and
feat.
Festus: We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths.
BAILEY Festus, A Country Town, sc. 7.
A feat exhibits strength, skill, personal power, whether mental or physical, especially the latter; as, a feat of
arms, a feat of memory. An exploit is a conspicuous or glorious deed, involving valor or heroism, usually
combined with strength, skill, loftiness of thought, and readiness of resource; an achievement is the doing of
something great and noteworthy; an exploit is brilliant, but its effect may be transient; an achievement is solid,
and its effect enduring. Act and action are both in contrast to all that is merely passive and receptive. The
intensest action is easier than passive endurance.
Antonyms:
cessation, immobility, inertia, quiet, suffering, deliberation, inaction, passion,[A] repose, suspension.
endurance, inactivity, quiescence, rest,
[A] In philosophic sense.
* * * * *
ACTIVE.
Synonyms:
agile, energetic, officious, sprightly, alert, expeditious, prompt, spry, brisk, industrious, quick, supple,
bustling, lively, ready, vigorous, busy, mobile, restless, wide awake. diligent, nimble,
Active refers to both quickness and constancy of action; in the former sense it is allied with agile, alert, brisk,
etc.; in the latter, with busy, diligent, industrious. The active love employment, the busy are actually
employed, the diligent and the industrious are habitually busy. The restless are active from inability to keep
quiet; their activity may be without purpose, or out of all proportion to the purpose contemplated. The
officious are undesirably active in the affairs of others. Compare ALERT; ALIVE; MEDDLESOME.
Antonyms:
dull, inactive, lazy, slow, heavy, indolent, quiescent, sluggish, idle, inert, quiet, stupid.
Prepositions:
Active in work, in a cause; for an object, as for justice; with persons or instrumentalities; about something, as
about other people's business.

ACUMEN.
Synonyms:
acuteness, insight, perspicacity, sharpness, cleverness, keenness, sagacity, shrewdness. discernment,
penetration,
Sharpness, acuteness, and insight, however keen, and penetration, however deep, fall short of the meaning of
acumen, which implies also ability to use these qualities to advantage. There are persons of keen insight and
great penetration to whom these powers are practically useless. Acumen is sharpness to some purpose, and
belongs to a mind that is comprehensive as well as keen. Cleverness is a practical aptitude for study or
learning. Insight and discernment are applied oftenest to the judgment of character; penetration and
perspicacity to other subjects of knowledge. Sagacity is an uncultured skill in using quick perceptions for a
desired end, generally in practical affairs; acumen may increase with study, and applies to the most erudite
matters. Shrewdness is keenness or sagacity, often with a somewhat evil bias, as ready to take advantage of
duller intellects. Perspicacity is the power to see clearly through that which is difficult or involved. We speak
of the acuteness of an observer or a reasoner, the insight and discernment of a student, a clergyman, or a
merchant, the sagacity of a hound, the keenness of a debater, the shrewdness of a usurer, the penetration,
perspicacity, and acumen of a philosopher.
Antonyms:
bluntness, dulness, obtuseness, stupidity.
* * * * *
ADD.
Synonyms:
adjoin, annex, augment, extend, make up, affix, append, cast up, increase, subjoin, amplify, attach, enlarge,
join on, sum up.
To add is to increase by adjoining or uniting: in distinction from multiply, which is to increase by repeating.
To augment a thing is to increase it by any means, but this word is seldom used directly of material objects;
we do not augment a house, a farm, a nation, etc. We may enlarge a house, a farm, or an empire, extend
influence or dominion, augment riches, power or influence, attach or annex a building to one that it adjoins or
papers to the document they refer to, annex a clause or a codicil, affix a seal or a signature, annex a territory,
attach a condition to a promise. A speaker may amplify a discourse by a fuller treatment throughout than was
originally planned, or he may append or subjoin certain remarks without change of what has gone before. We
cast up or sum up an account, though add up and make up are now more usual expressions.
Antonyms:
abstract, diminish, lessen, remove, withdraw. deduct, dissever, reduce, subtract,
Preposition:
Other items are to be added to the account.

ADDICTED.
Synonyms:
abandoned, devoted, given over, inclined, accustomed, disposed, given up, prone, attached, given, habituated,
wedded.
One is addicted to that which he has allowed to gain a strong, habitual, and enduring hold upon action,
inclination, or involuntary tendency, as to a habit or indulgence. A man may be accustomed to labor, attached
to his profession, devoted to his religion, given to study or to gluttony (in the bad sense, given over, or given
up, is a stronger and more hopeless expression, as is abandoned). One inclined to luxury may become
habituated to poverty. One is wedded to that which has become a second nature; as, one is wedded to science
or to art. Prone is used only in a bad sense, and generally of natural tendencies; as, our hearts are prone to
evil. Abandoned tells of the acquired viciousness of one who has given himself up to wickedness. Addicted
may be used in a good, but more frequently a bad sense; as, addicted to study; addicted to drink. Devoted is
used chiefly in the good sense; as, a mother's devoted affection.
Antonyms:
averse, disinclined, indisposed, unaccustomed.
Preposition:
Addicted to vice.

ADDRESS, v.
Synonyms:
cost, approach, hail, speak to, apostrophize, court, salute, woo. appeal, greet,
To accost is to speak first, to friend or stranger, generally with a view to opening conversation; greet is not so
distinctly limited, since one may return another's greeting; greet and hail may imply but a passing word;
greeting may be altogether silent; to hail is to greet in a loud-voiced and commonly hearty and joyous way, as
appears in the expression "hail fellow, well met." To salute is to greet with special token of respect, as a
soldier his commander. To apostrophize is to solemnly address some person or personified attribute apart
from the audience to whom one is speaking; as, a preacher may apostrophize virtue, the saints of old, or even
the Deity. To appeal is strictly to call for some form of help or support. Address is slightly more formal than
accost or greet, though it may often be interchanged with them. One may address another at considerable
length or in writing; he accosts orally and briefly.
Antonyms:
avoid, elude, overlook, pass by, cut, ignore, pass, shun.
Prepositions:
Address the memorial to the legislature; the president addressed the people in an eloquent speech; he
addressed an intruder with indignation.

ADDRESS, n.
Synonyms:
adroitness, discretion, manners, readiness, courtesy, ingenuity, politeness, tact. dexterity,
Address is that indefinable something which enables a man to gain his object without seeming exertion or
contest, and generally with the favor and approval of those with whom he deals. It is a general power to direct
to the matter in hand whatever qualities are most needed for it at the moment. It includes adroitness and
discretion to know what to do or say and what to avoid; ingenuity to devise; readiness to speak or act; the
dexterity that comes of practise; and tact, which is the power of fine touch as applied to human character and
feeling. Courtesy and politeness are indispensable elements of good address. Compare SPEECH.
Antonyms:
awkwardness, clumsiness, ill-breeding, stupidity, boorishness, fatuity, ill manners, unmannerliness,
clownishness, folly, rudeness, unwisdom.
Prepositions:
Address in dealing with opponents; the address of an accomplished intriguer; an address to the audience.
* * * * *
ADEQUATE.
Synonyms:
able, competent, fitted, satisfactory, adapted, equal, fitting, sufficient, capable, fit, qualified, suitable.
commensurate,
Adequate, commensurate, and sufficient signify equal to some given occasion or work; as, a sum sufficient to
meet expenses; an adequate remedy for the disease. Commensurate is the more precise and learned word,
signifying that which exactly measures the matter in question. Adapted, fit, suitable, and qualified refer to the
qualities which match or suit the occasion. A clergyman may have strength adequate to the work of a porter;
but that would not be a fit or suitable occupation for him. Work is satisfactory if it satisfies those for whom it
is done, though it may be very poor work judged by some higher standard. Qualified refers to acquired
abilities; competent to both natural and acquired; a qualified teacher may be no longer competent, by reason of
ill health. Able and capable suggest general ability and reserved power, able being the higher word of the two.
An able man will do something well in any position. A capable man will come up to any ordinary demand.
We say an able orator, a capable accountant.
Antonyms:
disqualified, inferior, unequal, unsatisfactory, useless, inadequate, insufficient, unfit, unsuitable, worthless.
incompetent, poor, unqualified,
Prepositions:
Adequate to the demand; for the purpose.
23
* * * * *
ADHERENT.
Synonyms:
aid, ally, disciple, partisan, supporter. aider, backer, follower,
An adherent is one who is devoted or attached to a person, party, principle, cause, creed, or the like. One may
be an aider and supporter of a party or church, while not an adherent to all its doctrines or claims. An ally is
more independent still, as he may differ on every point except the specific ground of union. The Allies who
overthrew Napoleon were united only against him. Allies are regarded as equals; adherents and disciples are
followers. The adherent depends more on his individual judgment, the disciple is more subject to command
and instruction; thus we say the disciples rather than the adherents of Christ. Partisan has the narrow and
odious sense of adhesion to a party, right or wrong. One may be an adherent or supporter of a party and not a
partisan. Backer is a sporting and theatrical word, personal in its application, and not in the best usage.
Compare ACCESSORY.
Antonyms:
adversary, betrayer, enemy, opponent, traitor. antagonist, deserter, hater, renegade,
Prepositions:
Adherents to principle; adherents of Luther.
* * * * *
ADHESIVE.
Synonyms:
cohesive, gummy, sticky, viscous. glutinous, sticking, viscid,
Adhesive is the scientific, sticking or sticky the popular word. That which is adhesive tends to join itself to the
surface of any other body with which it is placed in contact; cohesive expresses the tendency of particles of
the same substance to hold together. Polished plate glass is not adhesive, but such plates packed together are
intensely cohesive. An adhesive plaster is in popular language a sticking-plaster. Sticky expresses a more
limited, and generally annoying, degree of the same quality. Glutinous, gummy, viscid, and viscous are applied
to fluid or semi-fluid substances, as pitch or tar.
Antonyms:
free, inadhesive, loose, separable.
Preposition:
The stiff, wet clay, adhesive to the foot, impeded progress.
* * * * *
ADJACENT.
24
Synonyms:
abutting, bordering, contiguous, neighboring, adjoining, close, coterminous, next, attached, conterminous,
near, nigh. beside,
Adjacent farms may not be connected; if adjoining, they meet at the boundary-line. Conterminous would
imply that their dimensions were exactly equal on the side where they adjoin. Contiguous may be used for
either adjacent or adjoining. Abutting refers rather to the end of one building or estate than to the
neighborhood of another. Buildings may be adjacent or adjoining that are not attached. Near is a relative
word, places being called near upon the railroad which would elsewhere be deemed remote. Neighboring
always implies such proximity that the inhabitants may be neighbors. Next views some object as the nearest of
several or many; next neighbor implies a neighborhood.
Antonyms:
detached, disconnected, disjoined, distant, remote, separate.
Preposition:
The farm was adjacent to the village.
* * * * *
ADMIRE.
Synonyms:
adore, delight in, extol, respect, venerate, applaud, enjoy, honor, revere, wonder. approve, esteem, love,
In the old sense of wonder, admire is practically obsolete; the word now expresses a delight and approval, in
which the element of wonder unconsciously mingles. We admire beauty in nature and art, delight in the
innocent happiness of children, enjoy books or society, a walk or a dinner. We approve what is excellent,
applaud heroic deeds, esteem the good, love our friends. We honor and respect noble character wherever
found; we revere and venerate it in the aged. We extol the goodness and adore the majesty and power of God.
Antonyms:
abhor, contemn, detest, execrate, ridicule, abominate, despise, dislike, hate, scorn.
Preposition:
Admire at may still very rarely be found in the old sense of wonder at.
* * * * *
ADORN.
Synonyms:
beautify, decorate, garnish, illustrate, bedeck, embellish, gild, ornament. deck,
To embellish is to brighten and enliven by adding something that is not necessarily or very closely connected
25
with that to which it is added; to illustrate is to add something so far like in kind as to cast a side-light upon
the principal matter. An author embellishes his narrative with fine descriptions, the artist illustrates it with
beautiful engravings, the binder gilds and decorates the volume. Garnish is on a lower plane; as, the feast was
garnished with flowers. Deck and bedeck are commonly said of apparel; as, a mother bedecks her daughter
with silk and jewels. To adorn and to ornament alike signify to add that which makes anything beautiful and
attractive, but ornament is more exclusively on the material plane; as, the gateway was ornamented with
delicate carving. Adorn is more lofty and spiritual, referring to a beauty which is not material, and can not be
put on by ornaments or decorations, but seems in perfect harmony and unity with that to which it adds a grace;
if we say, the gateway was adorned with beautiful carving, we imply a unity and loftiness of design such as
ornamented can not express. We say of some admirable scholar or statesman, "he touched nothing that he did
not adorn."
At church, with meek and unaffected grace, His looks adorned the venerable place.
GOLDSMITH Deserted Village, l. 178.
Antonyms:
deface, deform, disfigure, mar, spoil.
Preposition:
Adorn his temples with a coronet.
* * * * *
AFFRONT.
Synonyms:
aggravate, exasperate, offend, vex, annoy, insult, provoke, wound. displease, irritate, tease,
One may be annoyed by the well-meaning awkwardness of a servant, irritated by a tight shoe or a thoughtless
remark, vexed at some careless neglect or needless misfortune, wounded by the ingratitude of child or friend.
To tease is to give some slight and perhaps playful annoyance. Aggravate in the sense of offend is colloquial.
To provoke, literally to call out or challenge, is to begin a contest; one provokes another to violence. To
affront is to offer some defiant offense or indignity, as it were, to one's face; it is somewhat less than to insult.
Compare PIQUE.
Antonyms:
conciliate, content, gratify, honor, please.
* * * * *
AGENT.
Synonyms:
actor, factor, means, operator, promoter. doer, instrument, mover, performer,
In strict philosophical usage, the prime mover or doer of an act is the agent. Thus we speak of man as a
26
voluntary agent, a free agent. But in common usage, especially in business, an agent is not the prime actor,
but only an instrument or factor, acting under orders or instructions. Compare CAUSE.
Antonyms:
chief, inventor, originator, principal.
Prepositions:
An agent of the company for selling, etc.
* * * * *
AGREE.
Synonyms:
accede, admit, coincide, concur, accept, approve, combine, consent, accord, assent, comply, harmonize.
acquiesce,
Agree is the most general term of this group, signifying to have like qualities, proportions, views, or
inclinations, so as to be free from jar, conflict, or contradiction in a given relation. To concur is to agree in
general; to coincide is to agree in every particular. Whether in application to persons or things, concur tends
to expression in action more than coincide; we may either concur or coincide in an opinion, but concur in a
decision; views coincide, causes concur. One accepts another's terms, complies with his wishes, admits his
statement, approves his plan, conforms to his views of doctrine or duty, accedes or consents to his proposal.
Accede expresses the more formal agreement, consent the more complete. To assent is an act of the
understanding; to consent, of the will. We may concur or agree with others, either in opinion or decision. One
may silently acquiesce in that which does not meet his views, but which he does not care to contest. He
admits the charge brought, or the statement made, by another--admit always carrying a suggestion of
reluctance. Assent is sometimes used for a mild form of consent, as if agreement in the opinion assured
approval of the decision.
Antonyms:
contend, demur, disagree, oppose, contradict, deny, dispute, protest, decline, differ, dissent, refuse.
Prepositions:
I agree in opinion with the speaker; to the terms proposed; persons agree on or upon a statement of principles,
rules, etc.; we must agree among ourselves.
* * * * *
AGRICULTURE.
Synonyms:
cultivation, gardening, kitchen-gardening, culture, horticulture, market-gardening, farming, husbandry, tillage.
floriculture,
Agriculture is the generic term, including at once the science, the art, and the process of supplying human
27
wants by raising the products of the soil, and by the associated industries; farming is the practise of
agriculture as a business; there may be theoretical agriculture, but not theoretical farming; we speak of the
science of agriculture, the business of farming; scientific agriculture may be wholly in books; scientific
farming is practised upon the land; we say an agricultural college rather than a college of farming. Farming
refers to the cultivation of considerable portions of land, and the raising of the coarser crops; gardening is the
close cultivation of a small area for small fruits, flowers, vegetables, etc., and while it may be done upon a
farm is yet a distinct industry. Gardening in general, kitchen-gardening, the cultivation of vegetables, etc., for
the household, market-gardening, the raising of the same for sale, floriculture, the culture of flowers, and
horticulture, the culture of fruits, flowers, or vegetables, are all departments of agriculture, but not strictly nor
ordinarily of farming; farming is itself one department of agriculture. Husbandry is a general word for any
form of practical agriculture, but is now chiefly poetical. Tillage refers directly to the work bestowed upon
the land, as plowing, manuring, etc.; cultivation refers especially to the processes that bring forward the crop;
we speak of the tillage of the soil, the cultivation of corn; we also speak of land as in a state of cultivation,
under cultivation, etc. Culture is now applied to the careful development of any product to a state of
perfection, especially by care through successive generations; the choice varieties of the strawberry have been
produced by wise and patient culture; a good crop in any year is the result of good cultivation.
* * * * *
AIM.
Synonyms:
aspiration, endeavor, intention, tendency. design, goal, mark, determination, inclination, object, end, intent,
purpose,
The aim is the direction in which one shoots, or sometimes that which is aimed at. The mark is that at which
one shoots; the goal, that toward which one runs. All alike indicate the direction of endeavor. The end is the
point at which one expects or hopes to close his labors; the object, that which he would grasp as the reward of
his labors. Aspiration, design, endeavor, purpose, referring to the mental acts by which the aim is attained, are
often used as interchangeable with aim. Aspiration applies to what are viewed as noble aims; endeavor,
design, intention, purpose, indifferently to the best or worst. Aspiration has less of decision than the other
terms; one may aspire to an object, and yet lack the fixedness of purpose by which alone it can be attained.
Purpose is stronger than intention. Design especially denotes the adaptation of means to an end; endeavor
refers to the exertions by which it is to be attained. One whose aims are worthy, whose aspirations are high,
whose designs are wise, and whose purposes are steadfast, may hope to reach the goal of his ambition, and
will surely win some object worthy of a life's endeavor. Compare AMBITION; DESIGN.
Antonyms:
aimlessness, heedlessness, negligence, purposelessness, avoidance, neglect, oversight, thoughtlessness.
carelessness,
* * * * *
AIR.
Synonyms:
appearance, demeanor, manner, sort, bearing, expression, mien, style, behavior, fashion, port, way. carriage,
look,
28
Air is that combination of qualities which makes the entire impression we receive in a person's presence; as,
we say he has the air of a scholar, or the air of a villain. Appearance refers more to the dress and other
externals. We might say of a travel-soiled pedestrian, he has the appearance of a tramp, but the air of a
gentleman. Expression and look especially refer to the face. Expression is oftenest applied to that which is
habitual; as, he has a pleasant expression of countenance; look may be momentary; as, a look of dismay
passed over his face. We may, however, speak of the look or looks as indicating all that we look at; as, he had
the look of an adventurer; I did not like his looks. Bearing is rather a lofty word; as, he has a noble bearing;
port is practically identical in meaning with bearing, but is more exclusively a literary word. Carriage, too, is
generally used in a good sense; as, that lady has a good carriage. Mien is closely synonymous with air, but
less often used in a bad sense. We say a rakish air rather than a rakish mien. Mien may be used to express
some prevailing feeling; as, "an indignant mien." Demeanor goes beyond appearance, including conduct,
behavior; as, a modest demeanor. Manner and style are, in large part at least, acquired. Compare BEHAVIOR.
* * * * *
AIRY.
Synonyms:
aerial, ethereal, frolicsome, joyous, lively, animated, fairylike, gay, light, sprightly.
Aerial and airy both signify of or belonging to the air, but airy also describes that which seems as if made of
air; we speak of airy shapes, airy nothings, where we could not well say aerial; ethereal describes its object as
belonging to the upper air, the pure ether, and so, often, heavenly. Sprightly, spiritlike, refers to light, free,
cheerful activity of mind and body. That which is lively or animated may be agreeable or the reverse; as, an
animated discussion; a lively company.
Antonyms:
clumsy, heavy, ponderous, sluggish, wooden. dull, inert, slow, stony,
* * * * *
ALARM.
Synonyms:
affright, disquietude, fright, solicitude, apprehension, dread, misgiving, terror, consternation, fear, panic,
timidity. dismay,
Alarm, according to its derivation all'arme, "to arms," is an arousing to meet and repel danger, and may be
quite consistent with true courage. Affright and fright express sudden fear which, for the time at least,
overwhelms courage. The sentinel discovers with alarm the sudden approach of the enemy; the unarmed
villagers view it with affright. Apprehension, disquietude, dread, misgiving, and solicitude are in anticipation
of danger; consternation, dismay, and terror are overwhelming fear, generally in the actual presence of that
which is terrible, though these words also may have an anticipative force. Timidity is a quality, habit, or
condition, a readiness to be affected with fear. A person of great timidity is constantly liable to needless alarm
and even terror. Compare FEAR.
Antonyms:
assurance, calmness, confidence, repose, security.
29
Prepositions:
Alarm was felt in the camp, among the soldiers, at the news.
* * * * *
ALERT.
Synonyms:
active, lively, prepared, vigilant, brisk, nimble, prompt, watchful, hustling, on the watch, ready, wide-awake.
Alert, ready, and wide-awake refer to a watchful promptness for action. Ready suggests thoughtful
preparation; the wandering Indian is alert, the trained soldier is ready. Ready expresses more life and vigor
than prepared. The gun is prepared; the man is ready. Prompt expresses readiness for appointment or demand
at the required moment. The good general is ready for emergencies, alert to perceive opportunity or peril,
prompt to seize occasion. The sense of brisk, nimble is the secondary and now less common signification of
alert. Compare ACTIVE; ALIVE; NIMBLE; VIGILANT.
Antonyms:
drowsy, dull, heavy, inactive, slow, sluggish, stupid.
* * * * *
ALIEN, a.
Synonyms:
conflicting, distant, inappropriate, strange, contradictory, foreign, irrelevant, unconnected, contrary, hostile,
opposed, unlike. contrasted, impertinent, remote,
Foreign refers to difference of birth, alien to difference of allegiance. In their figurative use, that is foreign
which is remote, unlike, or unconnected; that is alien which is conflicting, hostile, or opposed. Impertinent and
irrelevant matters can not claim consideration in a certain connection; inappropriate matters could not
properly be considered. Compare ALIEN, n.; CONTRAST, v.
Antonyms:
akin, apropos, germane, proper, appropriate, essential, pertinent, relevant.
Prepositions:
Such a purpose was alien to (or from) my thought: to preferable.
* * * * *
ALIEN, n.
Synonyms:
foreigner, stranger.
30
A naturalized citizen is not an alien, though a foreigner by birth, and perhaps a stranger in the place where he
resides. A person of foreign birth not naturalized is an alien, though he may have been resident in the country
a large part of a lifetime, and ceased to be a stranger to its people or institutions. He is an alien in one country
if his allegiance is to another. The people of any country still residing in their own land are, strictly speaking,
foreigners to the people of all other countries, rather than aliens; but alien and foreigner are often used
synonymously.
Antonyms:
citizen, fellow-countryman, native-born inhabitant, countryman, native, naturalized person.
Prepositions:
Aliens to (more rarely from) our nation and laws; aliens in our land, among our people.
* * * * *
ALIKE.
Synonyms:
akin, equivalent, kindred, same, analogous, homogeneous, like, similar, equal, identical, resembling, uniform.
Alike is a comprehensive word, signifying as applied to two or more objects that some or all qualities of one
are the same as those of the other or others; by modifiers alike may be made to express more or less
resemblance; as, these houses are somewhat (i. e., partially) alike; or, these houses are exactly (i. e., in all
respects) alike. Cotton and wool are alike in this, that they can both be woven into cloth. Substances are
homogeneous which are made up of elements of the same kind, or which are the same in structure. Two pieces
of iron may be homogeneous in material, while not alike in size or shape. In geometry, two triangles are equal
when they can be laid over one another, and fit, line for line and angle for angle; they are equivalent when
they simply contain the same amount of space. An identical proposition is one that says the same thing
precisely in subject and predicate. Similar refers to close resemblance, which yet leaves room for question or
denial of complete likeness or identity. To say "this is the identical man," is to say not merely that he is
similar to the one I have in mind, but that he is the very same person. Things are analogous when they are
similar in idea, plan, use, or character, tho perhaps quite unlike in appearance; as, the gills of fishes are said to
be analogous to the lungs in terrestrial animals.
Antonyms:
different, dissimilar, distinct, heterogeneous, unlike.
Prepositions:
The specimens are alike in kind; they are all alike to me.
* * * * *
ALIVE.
Synonyms:
active, breathing, live, quick, alert, brisk, lively, subsisting, animate, existent, living, vivacious. animated,
31
existing,
Alive applies to all degrees of life, from that which shows one to be barely existing or existent as a living
thing, as when we say he is just alive, to that which implies the very utmost of vitality and power, as in the
words "he is all alive," "thoroughly alive." So the word quick, which began by signifying "having life," is now
mostly applied to energy of life as shown in swiftness of action. Breathing is capable of like contrast. We say
of a dying man, he is still breathing; or we speak of a breathing statue, or "breathing and sounding, beauteous
battle," TENNYSON Princess can. v, l. 155, where it means having, or seeming to have, full and vigorous
breath, abundant life. Compare ACTIVE; ALERT; NIMBLE.
Antonyms:
dead, defunct, dull, lifeless, deceased, dispirited, inanimate, spiritless.
Prepositions:
Alive in every nerve; alive to every noble impulse; alive with fervor, hope, resolve; alive through all his
being.
* * * * *
ALLAY.
Synonyms:
alleviate, compose, quiet, still, appease, mollify, soothe, tranquilize. calm, pacify,
Allay and alleviate are closely kindred in signification, and have been often interchanged in usage. But, in
strictness, to allay is to lay to rest, quiet or soothe that which is excited; to alleviate, on the other hand, is to
lighten a burden. We allay suffering by using means to soothe and tranquilize the sufferer; we alleviate
suffering by doing something toward removal of the cause, so that there is less to suffer; where the trouble is
wholly or chiefly in the excitement, to allay the excitement is virtually to remove the trouble; as, to allay rage
or panic; we alleviate poverty, but do not allay it. Pacify, directly from the Latin, and appease, from the Latin
through the French, signify to bring to peace; to mollify is to soften; to calm, quiet, or tranquilize is to make
still; compose, to place together, unite, adjust to a calm and settled condition; to soothe (originally to assent to,
humor) is to bring to pleased quietude. We allay excitement, appease a tumult, calm agitation, compose our
feelings or countenance, pacify the quarrelsome, quiet the boisterous or clamorous, soothe grief or distress.
Compare ALLEVIATE.
Antonyms:
agitate, excite, kindle, rouse, stir up. arouse, fan, provoke, stir,
* * * * *
ALLEGE.
Synonyms:
adduce, asseverate, claim, maintain, produce, advance, assign, declare, offer, say, affirm, aver, introduce,
plead, state. assert, cite,
32
To allege is formally to state as true or capable of proof, but without proving. To adduce, literally to lead to, is
to bring the evidence up to what has been alleged. Adduce is a secondary word; nothing can be adduced in
evidence till something has been stated or alleged, which the evidence is to sustain. An alleged fact stands
open to question or doubt. To speak of an alleged document, an alleged will, an alleged crime, is either to
question, or at least very carefully to refrain from admitting, that the document exists, that the will is genuine,
or that the crime has been committed. Alleged is, however, respectful; to speak of the "so-called" will or deed,
etc., would be to cast discredit upon the document, and imply that the speaker was ready to brand it as
unquestionably spurious; alleged simply concedes nothing and leaves the question open. To produce is to
bring forward, as, for instance, papers or persons. Adduce is not used of persons; of them we say introduce or
produce. When an alleged criminal is brought to trial, the counsel on either side are accustomed to advance a
theory, and adduce the strongest possible evidence in its support; they will produce documents and witnesses,
cite precedents, assign reasons, introduce suggestions, offer pleas. The accused will usually assert his
innocence. Compare STATE.
* * * * *
ALLEGIANCE.
Synonyms:
devotion, fealty, loyalty, obedience, subjection. faithfulness, homage,
Allegiance is the obligation of fidelity and obedience that an individual owes to his government or sovereign,
in return for the protection he receives. The feudal uses of these words have mostly passed away with the state
of society that gave them birth; but their origin still colors their present meaning. A patriotic American feels
an enthusiastic loyalty to the republic; he takes, on occasion, an oath of allegiance to the government, but his
loyalty will lead him to do more than mere allegiance could demand; he pays homage to God alone, as the
only king and lord, or to those principles of right that are spiritually supreme; he acknowledges the duty of
obedience to all rightful authority; he resents the idea of subjection. Fealty is becoming somewhat rare, except
in elevated or poetic style. We prefer to speak of the faithfulness rather than the fealty of citizen, wife, or
friend.
Antonyms:
disaffection, disloyalty, rebellion, sedition, treason.
Prepositions:
We honor the allegiance of the citizen to the government; the government has a right to allegiance from the
citizen.
* * * * *
ALLEGORY.
Synonyms:
fable, fiction, illustration, metaphor, parable, simile.
In modern usage we may say that an allegory is an extended simile, while a metaphor is an abbreviated simile
contained often in a phrase, perhaps in a word. The simile carries its comparison on the surface, in the words
as, like, or similar expressions; the metaphor is given directly without any note of comparison. The allegory,
33
parable, or fable tells its story as if true, leaving the reader or hearer to discover its fictitious character and
learn its lesson. All these are, in strict definition, fictions; but the word fiction is now applied almost
exclusively to novels or romances. An allegory is a moral or religious tale, of which the moral lesson is the
substance, and all descriptions and incidents but accessories, as in "The Pilgrim's Progress." A fable is
generally briefer, representing animals as the speakers and actors, and commonly conveying some lesson of
practical wisdom or shrewdness, as "The Fables of sop." A parable is exclusively moral or religious, briefer
and less adorned than an allegory, with its lesson more immediately discernible, given, as it were, at a stroke.
Any comparison, analogy, instance, example, tale, anecdote, or the like which serves to let in light upon a
subject may be called an illustration, this word in its widest use including all the rest. Compare FICTION;
STORY.
Antonyms:
chronicle, fact, history, narrative, record.
* * * * *
ALLEVIATE.
Synonyms:
abate, lighten, reduce, remove, assuage, mitigate, relieve, soften. lessen, moderate,
Etymologically, to alleviate is to lift a burden toward oneself, and so lighten it for the bearer; to relieve is to
lift it back from the bearer, nearly or quite away; to remove is to take it away altogether. Alleviate is thus less
than relieve; relieve, ordinarily, less than remove. We alleviate, relieve or remove the trouble; we relieve, not
alleviate, the sufferer. Assuage is, by derivation, to sweeten; mitigate, to make mild; moderate, to bring within
measure; abate, to beat down, and so make less. We abate a fever; lessen anxiety; moderate passions or
desires; lighten burdens; mitigate or alleviate pain; reduce inflammation; soften, assuage, or moderate grief;
we lighten or mitigate punishments; we relieve any suffering of body or mind that admits of help, comfort, or
remedy. Alleviate has been often confused with allay. Compare ALLAY.
Antonyms:
aggravate, embitter, heighten, intensify, make worse. augment, enhance, increase, magnify,
* * * * *
ALLIANCE.
Synonyms:
coalition, confederation, fusion, partnership, compact, federation, league, union. confederacy,
Alliance is in its most common use a connection formed by treaty between sovereign states as for mutual aid
in war. Partnership is a mercantile word; alliance chiefly political or matrimonial. Coalition is oftenest used
of political parties; fusion is now the more common word in this sense. In an alliance between nations there is
no surrender of sovereignty, and no union except for a specified time and purpose. League and alliance are
used with scarcely perceptible difference of meaning. In a confederacy or confederation there is an attempt to
unite separate states in a general government without surrender of sovereignty. Union implies so much
concession as to make the separate states substantially one. Federation is mainly a poetic and rhetorical word
expressing something of the same thought, as in Tennyson's "federation of the world," Locksley Hall, l. 128.
34
The United States is not a confederacy nor an alliance; the nation might be called a federation, but prefers to
be styled a federal union.
Antonyms:
antagonism, disunion, enmity, schism, separation, discord, divorce, hostility, secession, war.
Prepositions:
Alliance with a neighboring people; against the common enemy; for offense and defense; alliance of, between,
or among nations.
* * * * *
ALLOT.
Synonyms:
appoint, destine, give, portion out, apportion, distribute, grant, select, assign, divide, mete out, set apart.
award,
Allot, originally to assign by lot, applies to the giving of a definite thing to a certain person. A portion or
extent of time is allotted; as, I expect to live out my allotted time. A definite period is appointed; as, the
audience assembled at the appointed hour. Allot may also refer to space; as, to allot a plot of ground for a
cemetery; but we now oftener use select, set apart, or assign. Allot is not now used of persons. Appoint may
be used of time, space, or person; as, the appointed day; the appointed place; an officer was appointed to this
station. Destine may also refer to time, place, or person, but it always has reference to what is considerably in
the future; a man appoints to meet his friend in five minutes; he destines his son to follow his own profession.
Assign is rarely used of time, but rather of places, persons, or things. We assign a work to be done and assign
a man to do it, who, if he fails, must assign a reason for not doing it. That which is allotted, appointed, or
assigned is more or less arbitrary; that which is awarded is the due requital of something the receiver has
done, and he has right and claim to it; as, the medal was awarded for valor. Compare APPORTION.
Antonyms:
appropriate, deny, resume, seize, confiscate, refuse, retain, withhold.
Prepositions:
Allot to a company for a purpose.

ALLOW.
Synonyms:
admit, consent to, let, sanction, tolerate, concede, grant, permit, suffer, yield.
We allow that which we do not attempt to hinder; we permit that to which we give some express
authorization. When this is given verbally it is called permission; when in writing it is commonly called a
permit. There are establishments that any one will be allowed to visit without challenge or hindrance; there are
35
others that no one is allowed to visit without a permit from the manager; there are others to which visitors are
admitted at specified times, without a formal permit. We allow a child's innocent intrusion; we concede a
right; grant a request; consent to a sale of property; permit an inspection of accounts; sanction a marriage;
tolerate the rudeness of a well-meaning servant; submit to a surgical operation; yield to a demand or necessity
against our wish or will, or yield something under compulsion; as, the sheriff yielded the keys at the muzzle of
a revolver, and allowed the mob to enter. Suffer, in the sense of mild concession, is now becoming rare, its
place being taken by allow, permit, or tolerate. Compare PERMISSION.
Antonyms:
deny, disapprove, protest, reject, withstand. disallow, forbid, refuse, resist,
See also synonyms for PROHIBIT.
Prepositions:
To allow of (in best recent usage, simply to allow) such an action; allow one in such a course; allow for
spending-money.
* * * * *
ALLOY.
Synonyms:
admixture, adulteration, debasement, deterioration.
Alloy may be either some admixture of baser with precious metal, as for giving hardness to coin or the like, or
it may be a compound or mixture of two or more metals. Adulteration, debasement, and deterioration are
always used in the bad sense; admixture is neutral, and may be good or bad; alloy is commonly good in the
literal sense. An excess of alloy virtually amounts to adulteration; but adulteration is now mostly restricted to
articles used for food, drink, medicine, and kindred uses. In the figurative sense, as applied to character, etc.,
alloy is unfavorable, because there the only standard is perfection.
* * * * *
ALLUDE.
Synonyms:
advert, indicate, intimate, point, signify, hint, insinuate, mention, refer, suggest. imply,
Advert, mention, and refer are used of language that more or less distinctly utters a certain thought; the others
of language from which it may be inferred. We allude to a matter slightly, perhaps by a word or phrase, as it
were in byplay; we advert to it when we turn from our path to treat it; we refer to it by any clear utterance that
distinctly turns the mind or attention to it; as, marginal figures refer to a parallel passage; we mention a thing
by explicit word, as by naming it. The speaker adverted to the recent disturbances and the remissness of
certain public officers; tho he mentioned no name, it was easy to see to whom he alluded. One may hint at a
thing in a friendly way, but what is insinuated is always unfavorable, generally both hostile and cowardly.
One may indicate his wishes, intimate his plans, imply his opinion, signify his will, suggest a course of action.
Compare SUGGESTION.
36
Preposition:
The passage evidently alludes to the Jewish Passover.
* * * * *
ALLURE.
Synonyms:
attract, captivate, decoy, entice, lure, tempt, cajole, coax, draw, inveigle, seduce, win.
To allure is to draw as with a lure by some charm or some prospect of pleasure or advantage. We may attract
others to a certain thing without intent; as, the good unconsciously attract others to virtue. We may allure
either to that which is evil or to that which is good and noble, by purpose and endeavor, as in the familiar line,
"Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way," GOLDSMITH Deserted Village, l. 170. Lure is rather more
akin to the physical nature. It is the word we would use of drawing on an animal. Coax expresses the
attraction of the person, not of the thing. A man may be coaxed to that which is by no means alluring. Cajole
and decoy carry the idea of deceiving and ensnaring. To inveigle is to lead one blindly in. To tempt is to
endeavor to lead one wrong; to seduce is to succeed in winning one from good to ill. Win may be used in
either a bad or a good sense, in which latter it surpasses the highest sense of allure, because it succeeds in that
which allure attempts; as, "He that winneth souls is wise," Prov. xi, 30.
Antonyms:
chill, damp, deter, dissuade, drive away, repel, warn.
Prepositions:
Allure to a course; allure by hopes; allure from evil to good.
* * * * *
ALSO.
Synonyms:
as well, in addition, likewise, too, as well as, in like manner, similarly, withal. besides,
While some distinctions between these words and phrases will appear to the careful student, yet in practise the
choice between them is largely to secure euphony and avoid repetition. The words fall into two groups; as
well as, besides, in addition, too, withal, simply add a fact or thought; also (all so), in like manner, likewise,
similarly, affirm that what is added is like that to which it is added. As well follows the word or phrase to
which it is joined. We can say the singers as well as the players, or the players, and the singers as well.
Antonyms:
but, nevertheless, on the contrary, yet. in spite of, notwithstanding, on the other hand,
* * * * *
ALTERNATIVE.
37
Synonyms:
choice, election, option, pick, preference, resource.
A choice may be among many things; an alternative is in the strictest sense a choice between two things;
oftener it is one of two things between which a choice is to be made, and either of which is the alternative of
the other; as, the alternative of surrender is death; or the two things between which there is a choice may be
called the alternatives; both Mill and Gladstone are quoted as extending the meaning of alternative to include
several particulars, Gladstone even speaking of "the fourth and last of these alternatives." Option is the right
or privilege of choosing; choice may be either the right to choose, the act of choosing, or the thing chosen. A
person of ability and readiness will commonly have many resources. Pick, from the Saxon, and election, from
the Latin, picture the objects before one, with freedom and power to choose which he will; as, there were
twelve horses, among which I could take my pick. A choice, pick, election, or preference is that which suits
one best; an alternative is that to which one is restricted; a resource, that to which one is glad to betake
oneself.
Antonyms:
compulsion, necessity.
* * * * *
AMASS.
Synonyms:
accumulate, collect, heap up, hoard up, store up. aggregate, gather, hoard, pile up,
To amass is to bring together materials that make a mass, a great bulk or quantity. With some occasional
exceptions, accumulate is applied to the more gradual, amass to the more rapid gathering of money or
materials, amass referring to the general result or bulk, accumulate to the particular process or rate of gain.
We say interest is accumulated (or accumulates) rather than is amassed; he accumulated a fortune in the
course of years; he rapidly amassed a fortune by shrewd speculations. Goods or money for immediate
distribution are said to be collected rather than amassed. They may be stored up for a longer or shorter time;
but to hoard is always with a view of permanent retention, generally selfish. Aggregate is now most
commonly used of numbers and amounts; as, the expenses will aggregate a round million.
Antonyms:
disperse, divide, portion, spend, waste. dissipate, parcel, scatter, squander,
Prepositions:
Amass for oneself; for a purpose; from a distance; with great labor; by industry.
* * * * *
AMATEUR.
Synonyms:
connoisseur, critic, dilettante, novice, tyro.
38
Etymologically, the amateur is one who loves, the connoisseur one who knows. In usage, the term amateur is
applied to one who pursues any study or art simply from the love of it; the word carries a natural implication
of superficialness, tho marked excellence is at times attained by amateurs. A connoisseur is supposed to be so
thoroughly informed regarding any art or work as to be able to criticize or select intelligently and
authoritatively; there are many incompetent critics, but there can not, in the true sense, be an incompetent
connoisseur. The amateur practises to some extent that in regard to which he may not be well informed; the
connoisseur is well informed in regard to that which he may not practise at all. A novice or tyro may be a
professional; an amateur never is; the amateur may be skilled and experienced as the novice or tyro never is.
Dilettante, which had originally the sense of amateur, has to some extent come to denote one who is
superficial, pretentious, and affected, whether in theory or practise.
Preposition:
An amateur in art.
* * * * *
AMAZEMENT.
Synonyms:
admiration, awe, confusion, surprise, astonishment, bewilderment, perplexity, wonder.
Amazement and astonishment both express the momentary overwhelming of the mind by that which is beyond
expectation. Astonishment especially affects the emotions, amazement the intellect. Awe is the yielding of the
mind to something supremely grand in character or formidable in power, and ranges from apprehension or
dread to reverent worship. Admiration includes delight and regard. Surprise lies midway between
astonishment and amazement, and usually respects matters of lighter consequence or such as are less startling
in character. Amazement may be either pleasing or painful, as when induced by the grandeur of the mountains,
or by the fury of the storm. We can say pleased surprise, but scarcely pleased astonishment. Amazement has in
it something of confusion or bewilderment; but confusion and bewilderment may occur without amazement, as
when a multitude of details require instant attention. Astonishment may be without bewilderment or confusion.
Wonder is often pleasing, and may be continuous in view of that which surpasses our comprehension; as, the
magnitude, order, and beauty of the heavens fill us with increasing wonder. Compare PERPLEXITY.
Antonyms:
anticipation, composure, expectation, preparation, steadiness, calmness, coolness, indifference,
self-possession, stoicism.
Preposition:
I was filled with amazement at such reckless daring.
* * * * *
AMBITION.
Synonyms:
aspiration, competition, emulation, opposition, rivalry.
39
Aspiration is the desire for excellence, pure and simple. Ambition, literally a going around to solicit votes, has
primary reference to the award or approval of others, and is the eager desire of power, fame, or something
deemed great and eminent, and viewed as a worthy prize. The prizes of aspiration are virtue, nobility, skill, or
other high qualities. The prizes of ambition are advancement, fame, honor, and the like. There is a noble and
wise or an ignoble, selfish, and harmful ambition. Emulation is not so much to win any excellence or success
for itself as to equal or surpass other persons. There is such a thing as a noble emulation, when those we
would equal or surpass are noble, and the means we would use worthy. But, at the highest, emulation is
inferior as a motive to aspiration, which seeks the high quality or character for its own sake, not with
reference to another. Competition is the striving for something that is sought by another at the same time.
Emulation regards the abstract, competition the concrete; rivalry is the same in essential meaning with
competition, but differs in the nature of the objects contested for, which, in the case of rivalry, are usually of
the nobler sort and less subject to direct gaging, measurement, and rule. We speak of competition in business,
emulation in scholarship, rivalry in love, politics, etc.; emulation of excellence, success, achievement;
competition for a prize; rivalry between persons or nations. Competition may be friendly, rivalry is commonly
hostile. Opposition is becoming a frequent substitute for competition in business language; it implies that the
competitor is an opponent and hinderer.
Antonyms:
carelessness, contentment, humility, indifference, satisfaction.
* * * * *
AMEND.
Synonyms:
advance, correct, meliorate, rectify, ameliorate, emend, mend, reform, better, improve, mitigate, repair.
cleanse, make better, purify,
To amend is to change for the better by removing faults, errors, or defects, and always refers to that which at
some point falls short of a standard of excellence. Advance, better, and improve may refer either to what is
quite imperfect or to what has reached a high degree of excellence; we advance the kingdom of God, improve
the minds of our children, better the morals of the people. But for matters below the point of ordinary
approval we seldom use these words; we do not speak of bettering a wretched alley, or improving a foul
sewer. There we use cleanse, purify, or similar words. We correct evils, reform abuses, rectify incidental
conditions of evil or error; we ameliorate poverty and misery, which we can not wholly remove. We mend a
tool, repair a building, correct proof; we amend character or conduct that is faulty, or a statement or law that
is defective. A text, writing, or statement is amended by the author or by some adequate authority; it is often
emended by conjecture. A motion is amended by the mover or by the assembly; a constitution is amended by
the people; an ancient text is emended by a critic who believes that what seems to him the better reading is
what the author wrote. Compare ALLEVIATE.
Antonyms:
aggravate, debase, harm, mar, tarnish, blemish, depress, impair, spoil, vitiate. corrupt, deteriorate, injure,
* * * * *
AMIABLE.
Synonyms:
40
agreeable, engaging, lovable, pleasing, attractive, gentle, lovely, sweet, benignant, good-natured, loving,
winning, harming, kind, pleasant, winsome.
Amiable combines the senses of lovable or lovely and loving; the amiable character has ready affection and
kindliness for others, with the qualities that are adapted to win their love; amiable is a higher and stronger
word than good-natured or agreeable. Lovely is often applied to externals; as, a lovely face. Amiable denotes a
disposition desirous to cheer, please, and make happy. A selfish man of the world may have the art to be
agreeable; a handsome, brilliant, and witty person may be charming or even attractive, while by no means
amiable. The engaging, winning, and winsome add to amiability something of beauty, accomplishments, and
grace. The benignant are calmly kind, as from a height and a distance. Kind, good-natured people may be
coarse and rude, and so fail to be agreeable or pleasing; the really amiable are likely to avoid such faults by
their earnest desire to please. The good-natured have an easy disposition to get along comfortably with every
one in all circumstances. A sweet disposition is very sure to be amiable, the loving heart bringing out all that
is lovable and lovely in character.
Antonyms:
acrimonious, crusty, hateful, ill-tempered, surly, churlish, disagreeable, ill-conditioned, morose, unamiable,
crabbed, dogged, ill-humored, sour, unlovely, cruel, gruff, ill-natured, sullen,
* * * * *
AMID.
Synonyms:
amidst, amongst, betwixt, mingled with, among, between, in the midst of, surrounded by.
Amid or amidst denotes surrounded by; among or amongst denotes mingled with. Between (archaic or poetic,
betwixt) is said of two persons or objects, or of two groups of persons or objects. "Let there be no strife, I pray
thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen," Gen. xiii, 9; the reference being to
two bodies of herdmen. Amid denotes mere position; among, some active relation, as of companionship,
hostility, etc. Lowell's "Among my Books" regards the books as companions; amid my books would suggest
packing, storing, or some other incidental circumstance. We say among friends, or among enemies, amidst the
woods, amid the shadows. In the midst of may have merely the local meaning; as, I found myself in the midst
of a crowd; or it may express even closer association than among; as, "I found myself in the midst of friends"
suggests their pressing up on every side, oneself the central object; so, "where two or three are met together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them," Matt. xviii, 20; in which case it would be feebler to say "among
them," impossible to say "amid them," not so well to say "amidst them."
Antonyms:
afar from, away from, beyond, far from, outside, without.
* * * * *
AMPLIFY.
Synonyms:
augment, dilate, expand, extend, unfold, develop, enlarge, expatiate, increase, widen.
41
Amplify is now rarely used in the sense of increase, to add material substance, bulk, volume, or the like; it is
now almost wholly applied to discourse or writing, signifying to make fuller in statement, whether with or
without adding matter of importance, as by stating fully what was before only implied, or by adding
illustrations to make the meaning more readily apprehended, etc. The chief difficulty of very young writers is
to amplify, to get beyond the bare curt statement by developing, expanding, unfolding the thought. The chief
difficulty of those who have more material and experience is to condense sufficiently. So, in the early days of
our literature amplify was used in the favorable sense; but at present this word and most kindred words are
coming to share the derogatory meaning that has long attached to expatiate. We may develop a thought,
expand an illustration, extend a discussion, expatiate on a hobby, dilate on something joyous or sad, enlarge a
volume, unfold a scheme, widen the range of treatment.
Antonyms:
abbreviate, amputate, condense, cut down, reduce, summarize, abridge, "boil down," curtail, epitomize,
retrench, sum up.
Prepositions:
To amplify on or upon the subject is needless. Amplify this matter by illustrations.
* * * * *
ANALOGY.
Synonyms:
affinity, likeness, relation, similarity, coincidence, parity, resemblance, simile, comparison, proportion,
semblance, similitude.
Analogy is specifically a resemblance of relations; a resemblance that may be reasoned from, so that from the
likeness in certain respects we may infer that other and perhaps deeper relations exist. Affinity is a mutual
attraction with or without seeming likeness; as, the affinity of iron for oxygen. Coincidence is complete
agreement in some one or more respects; there may be a coincidence in time of most dissimilar events. Parity
of reasoning is said of an argument equally conclusive on subjects not strictly analogous. Similitude is a
rhetorical comparison of one thing to another with which it has some points in common. Resemblance and
similarity are external or superficial, and may involve no deeper relation; as, the resemblance of a cloud to a
distant mountain. Compare ALLEGORY.
Antonyms:
disagreement, disproportion, dissimilarity, incongruity, unlikeness.
Prepositions:
The analogy between (or of) nature and revelation; the analogy of sound to light; a family has some analogy
with (or to) a state.
* * * * *
ANGER.
Synonyms:
42
animosity, fury, offense, rage, choler, impatience, passion, resentment, displeasure, indignation, peevishness,
temper, exasperation, ire, pettishness, vexation, fretfulness, irritation, petulance, wrath.
Displeasure is the mildest and most general word. Choler and ire, now rare except in poetic or highly
rhetorical language, denote a still, and the latter a persistent, anger. Temper used alone in the sense of anger is
colloquial, tho we may correctly say a hot temper, a fiery temper, etc. Passion, tho a word of far wider
application, may, in the singular, be employed to denote anger; "did put me in a towering passion,"
SHAKESPEARE Hamlet act v, sc. 2. Anger is violent and vindictive emotion, which is sharp, sudden, and,
like all violent passions, necessarily brief. Resentment (a feeling back or feeling over again) is persistent, the
bitter brooding over injuries. Exasperation, a roughening, is a hot, superficial intensity of anger, demanding
instant expression. Rage drives one beyond the bounds of prudence or discretion; fury is stronger yet, and
sweeps one away into uncontrollable violence. Anger is personal and usually selfish, aroused by real or
supposed wrong to oneself, and directed specifically and intensely against the person who is viewed as
blameworthy. Indignation is impersonal and unselfish displeasure at unworthy acts (L. indigna), i. e., at
wrong as wrong. Pure indignation is not followed by regret, and needs no repentance; it is also more
self-controlled than anger. Anger is commonly a sin; indignation is often a duty. Wrath is deep and perhaps
vengeful displeasure, as when the people of Nazareth were "filled with wrath" at the plain words of Jesus
(Luke iv, 28); it may, however, simply express the culmination of righteous indignation without malice in a
pure being; as, the wrath of God. Impatience, fretfulness, irritation, peevishness, pettishness, petulance, and
vexation express the slighter forms of anger. Irritation, petulance, and vexation are temporary and for
immediate cause. Fretfulness, pettishness, and peevishness are chronic states finding in any petty matter an
occasion for their exercise. Compare ACRIMONY; ENMITY; HATRED.
Antonyms:
amiability, leniency, mildness, peacefulness, charity, lenity, patience, self-control, forbearance,
long-suffering, peace, self-restraint. gentleness, love, peaceableness,
Prepositions:
Anger at the insult prompted the reply. Anger toward the offender exaggerates the offense.
* * * * *
ANIMAL.
Synonyms:
beast, fauna, living organism, sentient being. brute, living creature,
An animal is a sentient being, distinct from inanimate matter and from vegetable life on the one side and from
mental and spiritual existence on the other. Thus man is properly classified as an animal. But because the
animal life is the lowest and rudest part of his being and that which he shares with inferior creatures, to call
any individual man an animal is to imply that the animal nature has undue supremacy, and so is deep
condemnation or utter insult. The brute is the animal viewed as dull to all finer feeling; the beast is looked
upon as a being of appetites. To call a man a brute is to imply that he is unfeeling and cruel; to call him a
beast is to indicate that he is vilely sensual. We speak of the cruel father as a brute to his children; of the
drunkard as making a beast of himself. So firmly are these figurative senses established that we now incline to
avoid applying brute or beast to any creature, as a horse or dog, for which we have any affection; we prefer in
such cases the word animal. Creature is a word of wide signification, including all the things that God has
created, whether inanimate objects, plants, animals, angels, or men. The animals of a region are collectively
called its fauna.
43
Antonyms:
angel, man, mind, soul, substance (material), inanimate object, matter, mineral, spirit, vegetable.

ANNOUNCE.
Synonyms:
advertise, give notice (of), proclaim, reveal, circulate, give out, promulgate, say, communicate, herald,
propound, spread abroad, declare, make known, publish, state, enunciate, notify, report, tell.
To announce is to give intelligence of in some formal or public way. We may announce that which has
occurred or that which is to occur, tho the word is chiefly used in the anticipative sense; we announce a book
when it is in press, a guest when he arrives. We advertise our business, communicate our intentions, enunciate
our views; we notify an individual, give notice to the public. Declare has often an authoritative force; to
declare war is to cause war to be, where before there may have been only hostilities; we say declare war,
proclaim peace. We propound a question or an argument, promulgate the views of a sect or party, or the
decision of a court, etc. We report an interview, reveal a secret, herald the coming of some distinguished
person or great event. Publish, in popular usage, is becoming closely restricted to the sense of issuing through
the press; we announce a book that is to be published.
Antonyms:
bury, cover (up), hush, keep secret, suppress, conceal, hide, keep back, secrete, withhold.
Prepositions:
The event was announced to the family by telegraph.
* * * * *
ANSWER.
Synonyms:
rejoinder, repartee, reply, response, retort.
A verbal answer is a return of words to something that seems to call for them, and is made to a charge as well
as to a question; an answer may be even made to an unspoken implication or manifestation; see Luke v, 22. In
a wider sense, anything said or done in return for some word, action, or suggestion of another may be called
an answer. The blow of an enraged man, the whinny of a horse, the howling of the wind, the movement of a
bolt in a lock, an echo, etc., may each be an answer to some word or movement. A reply is an unfolding, and
ordinarily implies thought and intelligence. A rejoinder is strictly an answer to a reply, tho often used in the
general sense of answer, but always with the implication of something more or less controversial or opposed,
tho lacking the conclusiveness implied in answer; an answer, in the full sense, to a charge, an argument, or an
objection is adequate, and finally refutes and disposes of it; a reply or rejoinder may be quite inadequate, so
that one may say, "This reply is not an answer;" "I am ready with an answer" means far more than "I am
ready with a reply." A response is accordant or harmonious, designed or adapted to carry on the thought of the
words that called it forth, as the responses in a liturgical service, or to meet the wish of him who seeks it; as,
the appeal for aid met a prompt and hearty response. Repartee is a prompt, witty, and commonly good-natured
44
answer to some argument or attack; a retort may also be witty, but is severe and may be even savage in its
intensity.
Prepositions:
An answer in writing, or by word of mouth, to the question.
* * * * *
ANTICIPATE.
Synonyms:
apprehend, forecast, hope, expect, foretaste, look forward to.
To anticipate may be either to take before in fact or to take before in thought; in the former sense it is allied
with prevent; in the latter, with the synonyms above given. This is coming to be the prevalent and favorite
use. We expect that which we have good reason to believe will happen; as, a boy expects to grow to manhood.
We hope for that which we much desire and somewhat expect. We apprehend what we both expect and fear.
Anticipate is commonly used now, like foretaste, of that which we expect both with confidence and pleasure.
In this use it is a stronger word than hope, where often "the wish is father to the thought." I hope for a visit
from my friend, tho I have no word from him; I expect it when he writes that he is coming; and as the time
draws near I anticipate it with pleasure. Compare ABIDE; PREVENT.
Antonyms:
despair of, doubt, dread, fear, recall, recollect, remember. distrust,
* * * * *
ANTICIPATION.
Synonyms:
antepast, expectation, foresight, hope, apprehension, foreboding, foretaste, presentiment, expectancy, forecast,
forethought, prevision.
Expectation may be either of good or evil; presentiment almost always, apprehension and foreboding always,
of evil; anticipation and antepast, commonly of good. Thus, we speak of the pleasures of anticipation. A
foretaste may be of good or evil, and is more than imaginary; it is a part actually received in advance.
Foresight and forethought prevent future evil and secure future good by timely looking forward, and acting
upon what is foreseen. Compare ANTICIPATE.
Antonyms:
astonishment, despair, dread, fear, surprise, consummation, doubt, enjoyment, realization, wonder.
* * * * *
ANTIPATHY.
Synonyms:
45
abhorrence, disgust, hatred, repugnance, antagonism, dislike, hostility, repulsion, aversion, distaste,
opposition, uncongeniality. detestation,
Antipathy, repugnance, and uncongeniality are instinctive; other forms of dislike may be acquired or cherished
for cause. Uncongeniality is negative, a want of touch or sympathy. An antipathy to a person or thing is an
instinctive recoil from connection or association with that person or thing, and may be physical or mental, or
both. Antagonism may result from the necessity of circumstances; opposition may spring from conflicting
views or interests; abhorrence and detestation may be the result of religious and moral training; distaste and
disgust may be acquired; aversion is a deep and permanent dislike. A natural antipathy may give rise to
opposition which may result in hatred and hostility. Compare ACRIMONY; ANGER; ENMITY; HATRED.
Antonyms:
affinity, attraction, fellow-feeling, kindliness, sympathy. agreement, congeniality, harmony, regard,
Prepositions:
Antipathy to (less frequently for or against) a person or thing; antipathy between or betwixt two persons or
things.
* * * * *
ANTIQUE.
Synonyms:
ancient, old-fashioned, quaint, superannuated. antiquated,
Antique refers to an ancient, antiquated to a discarded style. Antique is that which is either ancient in fact or
ancient in style. The reference is to the style rather than to the age. We can speak of the antique architecture
of a church just built. The difference between antiquated and antique is not in the age, for a Puritan style may
be scorned as antiquated, while a Roman or Renaissance style may be prized as antique. The antiquated is not
so much out of date as out of vogue. Old-fashioned may be used approvingly or contemptuously. In the latter
case it becomes a synonym for antiquated; in the good sense it approaches the meaning of antique, but
indicates less duration. We call a wide New England fireplace old-fashioned; a coin of the Csars, antique.
Quaint combines the idea of age with a pleasing oddity; as, a quaint gambrel-roofed house. Antiquated is
sometimes used of persons in a sense akin to superannuated. The antiquated person is out of style and out of
sympathy with the present generation by reason of age; the superannuated person is incapacitated for present
activities by reason of age. Compare OLD.
Antonyms:
fashionable, fresh, modern, modish, new, recent, stylish.

ANXIETY.
Synonyms:
anguish, disquiet, foreboding, perplexity, apprehension, disturbance, fretfulness, solicitude, care, dread,
fretting, trouble, concern, fear, misgiving, worry.
46
Anxiety is, according to its derivation, a choking disquiet, akin to anguish; anxiety is mental; anguish may be
mental or physical; anguish is in regard to the known, anxiety in regard to the unknown; anguish is because of
what has happened, anxiety because of what may happen. Anxiety refers to some future event, always
suggesting hopeful possibility, and thus differing from apprehension, fear, dread, foreboding, terror, all of
which may be quite despairing. In matters within our reach, anxiety always stirs the question whether
something can not be done, and is thus a valuable spur to doing; in this respect it is allied to care. Foreboding,
dread, etc., commonly incapacitate for all helpful thought or endeavor. Worry is a more petty, restless, and
manifest anxiety; anxiety may be quiet and silent; worry is communicated to all around. Solicitude is a milder
anxiety. Fretting or fretfulness is a weak complaining without thought of accomplishing or changing anything,
but merely as a relief to one's own disquiet. Perplexity often involves anxiety, but may be quite free from it. A
student may be perplexed regarding a translation, yet, if he has time enough, not at all anxious regarding it.
Antonyms:
apathy, calmness, confidence, light-heartedness, satisfaction, assurance, carelessness, ease, nonchalance,
tranquillity.
Prepositions:
Anxiety for a friend's return; anxiety about, in regard to, or concerning the future.
* * * * *
APATHY.
Synonyms:
calmness, indifference, quietness, stoicism, composure, insensibility, quietude, tranquillity, immobility,
lethargy, sluggishness, unconcern, impassibility, phlegm, stillness, unfeelingness.
Apathy, according to its Greek derivation, is a simple absence of feeling or emotion. There are persons to
whom a certain degree of apathy is natural, an innate sluggishness of the emotional nature. In the apathy of
despair, a person gives up, without resistance or sensibility, to what he has fiercely struggled to avoid. While
apathy is want of feeling, calmness is feeling without agitation. Calmness is the result of strength, courage, or
trust; apathy is the result of dulness or weakness. Composure is freedom from agitation or disturbance,
resulting ordinarily from force of will, or from perfect confidence in one's own resources. Impassibility is a
philosophical term applied to the Deity, as infinitely exalted above all stir of passion or emotion.
Unfeelingness, the Saxon word that should be the exact equivalent of apathy, really means more, a lack of the
feeling one ought to have, a censurable hardness of heart. Indifference and insensibility designate the absence
of feeling toward certain persons or things; apathy, entire absence of feeling. Indifference is a want of interest;
insensibility is a want of feeling; unconcern has reference to consequences. We speak of insensibility of heart,
immobility of countenance. Stoicism is an intentional suppression of feeling and deadening of sensibilities,
while apathy is involuntary. Compare CALM; REST; STUPOR.
Antonyms:
agitation, disturbance, feeling, sensibility, sympathy, alarm, eagerness, frenzy, sensitiveness, turbulence,
anxiety, emotion, fury, storm, vehemence, care, excitement, passion, susceptibility, violence. distress,
Prepositions:
The apathy of monastic life; apathy toward good.

APIECE.
Synonyms:
distributively, each, individually, separately, severally.
There is no discernible difference in sense between so much apiece and so much each; the former is the more
common and popular, the latter the more elegant expression. Distributively is generally used of numbers and
abstract relations. Individually emphasizes the independence of the individuals; separately and severally still
more emphatically hold them apart. The signers of a note may become jointly and severally responsible, that
is, each liable for the entire amount, as if he had signed it alone. Witnesses are often brought separately into
court, in order that no one may be influenced by the testimony of another. If a company of laborers demand a
dollar apiece, that is a demand that each shall receive that sum; if they individually demand a dollar, each
individual makes the demand.
Antonyms:
accumulatively, confusedly, indiscriminately, together, unitedly. collectively, en masse, synthetically,
* * * * *
APOLOGY.
Synonyms:
acknowledgment, defense, excuse, plea, confession, exculpation, justification, vindication.
All these words express one's answer to a charge of wrong or error that is or might be made. Apology has
undergone a remarkable change from its old sense of a valiant defense--as in Justin Martyr's Apologies for the
Christian faith--to its present meaning of humble confession and concession. He who offers an apology admits
himself, at least technically and seemingly, in the wrong. An apology is for what one has done or left undone;
an excuse may be for what one proposes to do or leave undone as well; as, one sends beforehand his excuse
for not accepting an invitation; if he should fail either to be present or to excuse himself, an apology would be
in order. An excuse for a fault is an attempt at partial justification; as, one alleges haste as an excuse for
carelessness. Confession is a full acknowledgment of wrong, generally of a grave wrong, with or without
apology or excuse. Plea ranges in sense from a prayer for favor or pardon to an attempt at full vindication.
Defense, exculpation, justification, and vindication are more properly antonyms than synonyms of apology in
its modern sense, and should be so given, but for their connection with its historic usage. Compare
CONFESS; DEFENSE.
Antonyms:
accusation, charge, condemnation, injury, offense, censure, complaint, imputation, insult, wrong.
Prepositions:
An apology to the guest for the oversight would be fitting.
* * * * *
48
APPARENT.
Synonyms:
likely, presumable, probable, seeming.
The apparent is that which appears; the word has two contrasted senses, either of that which is manifest,
visible, certain, or of that which merely seems to be and may be very different from what is; as, the apparent
motion of the sun around the earth. Apparent kindness casts a doubt on the reality of the kindness; apparent
neglect implies that more care and pains may have been bestowed than we are aware of. Presumable implies
that a thing may be reasonably supposed beforehand without any full knowledge of the facts. Probable
implies that we know facts enough to make us moderately confident of it. Seeming expresses great doubt of
the reality; seeming innocence comes very near in meaning to probable guilt. Apparent indicates less
assurance than probable, and more than seeming. A man's probable intent we believe will prove to be his real
intent; his seeming intent we believe to be a sham; his apparent intent may be the true one, tho we have not
yet evidence on which to pronounce with certainty or even with confidence. Likely is a word with a wide
range of usage, but always implying the belief that the thing is, or will be, true; it is often used with the
infinitive, as the other words of this list can not be; as, it is likely to happen. Compare EVIDENT.
Antonyms:
doubtful, dubious, improbable, unimaginable, unlikely.
Prepositions:
(When apparent is used in the sense of evident): His guilt is apparent in every act to all observers.
* * * * *
APPEAR.
Synonyms:
have the appearance or semblance, look, seem.
Appear and look refer to what manifests itself to the senses; to a semblance or probability presented directly to
the mind. Seem applies to what is manifest to the mind on reflection. It suddenly appears to me that there is
smoke in the distance; as I watch, it looks like a fire; from my knowledge of the locality and observation of
particulars, it seems to me a farmhouse must be burning.
Antonyms:
be, be certain, real, or true, be the fact, exist.
Prepositions:
Appear at the front; among the first; on or upon the surface; to the eye; in evidence, in print; from reports;
near the harbor; before the public; in appropriate dress; with the insignia of his rank; above the clouds; below
the surface; under the lee; over the sea; through the mist; appear for, in behalf of, or against one in court.
* * * * *
49
APPENDAGE.
Synonyms:
accessory, addition, appurtenance, concomitant, accompaniment, adjunct, attachment, extension, addendum,
appendix, auxiliary, supplement.
An adjunct (something joined to) constitutes no real part of the thing or system to which it is joined, tho
perhaps a valuable addition; an appendage is commonly a real, tho not an essential or necessary part of that
with which it is connected; an appurtenance belongs subordinately to something by which it is employed,
especially as an instrument to accomplish some purpose. A horse's tail is at once an ornamental appendage
and a useful appurtenance; we could not call it an adjunct, tho we might use that word of his iron shoes. An
attachment in machinery is some mechanism that can be brought into optional connection with the principal
movement; a hemmer is a valuable attachment of a sewing-machine. An extension, as of a railroad or of a
franchise, carries out further something already existing. We add an appendix to a book, to contain names,
dates, lists, etc., which would encumber the text; we add a supplement to supply omissions, as, for instance, to
bring it up to date. An appendix may be called an addendum; but addendum may be used of a brief note,
which would not be dignified by the name of appendix; such notes are often grouped as addenda. An addition
might be matter interwoven in the body of the work, an index, plates, editorial notes, etc., which might be
valuable additions, but not within the meaning of appendix or supplement. Compare ACCESSORY;
AUXILIARY.
Antonyms:
main body, original, total, whole.
Prepositions:
That which is thought of as added we call an appendage to; that which is looked upon as an integral part is
called an appendage of.
* * * * *
APPETITE.
Synonyms:
appetency, impulse, lust, propensity, craving, inclination, passion, relish, desire, liking, proclivity, thirst,
disposition, longing, proneness, zest.
Appetite is used only of the demands of the physical system, unless otherwise expressly stated, as when we
say an appetite for knowledge; passion includes all excitable impulses of our nature, as anger, fear, love,
hatred, etc. Appetite is thus more animal than passion; and when we speak of passions and appetites as
conjoined or contrasted, we think of the appetites as wholly physical and of the passions as, in part at least,
mental or spiritual. We say an appetite for food, a passion for fame. Compare DESIRE.
Antonyms:
antipathy, disgust, distaste, indifference, repugnance, aversion, dislike, hatred, loathing, repulsion. detestation,
disrelish,
Compare ANTIPATHY.
50
Preposition:
He had an insatiable appetite for the marvellous.
* * * * *
APPORTION.
Synonyms:
allot, appropriate, deal, distribute, grant, appoint, assign, dispense, divide, share.
To allot or assign may be to make an arbitrary division; the same is true of distribute or divide. That which is
apportioned is given by some fixed rule, which is meant to be uniform and fair; as, representatives are
apportioned among the States according to population. To dispense is to give out freely; as, the sun dispenses
light and heat. A thing is appropriated to or for a specific purpose (to which it thus becomes proper, in the
original sense of being its own); money appropriated by Congress for one purpose can not be expended for
any other. One may apportion what he only holds in trust; he shares what is his own. Compare ALLOT.
Antonyms:
cling to, consolidate, gather together, receive, collect, divide arbitrarily, keep together, retain.
Prepositions:
Apportion to each a fair amount; apportion the property among the heirs, between two claimants; apportion
according to numbers, etc.
* * * * *
APPROXIMATION.
Synonyms:
approach, likeness, neighborhood, resemblance, contiguity, nearness, propinquity, similarity.
In mathematics, approximation is not guesswork, not looseness, and not error. The process of approximation
is as exact and correct at every point as that by which an absolute result is secured; the result only fails of
exactness because of some inherent difficulty in the problem. The attempt to "square the circle" gives only an
approximate result, because of the impossibility of expressing the circumference in terms of the radius. But
the limits of error on either side are known, and the approximation has practical value. Outside of
mathematics, the correct use of approximation (and the kindred words approximate and approximately) is to
express as near an approach to accuracy and certainty as the conditions of human thought or action in any
given case make possible. Resemblance and similarity may be but superficial and apparent; approximation is
real. Approach is a relative term, indicating that one has come nearer than before, tho the distance may yet be
considerable; an approximation brings one really near. Nearness, neighborhood, and propinquity are
commonly used of place; approximation, of mathematical calculations and abstract reasoning; we speak of
approach to the shore, nearness to the town, approximation to the truth.
Antonyms:
difference, distance, error, remoteness, unlikeness, variation.
51
Prepositions:
The approximation of the vegetable to the animal type.
* * * * *
ARMS.
Synonyms:
accouterments, armor, harness, mail, weapons.
Arms are implements of attack; armor is a defensive covering. The knight put on his armor; he grasped his
arms. With the disuse of defensive armor the word has practically gone out of military use, but it is still
employed in the navy, where the distinction is clearly preserved; any vessel provided with cannon is an armed
vessel; an armored ship is an ironclad. Anything that can be wielded in fight may become a weapon, as a
pitchfork or a paving-stone; arms are especially made and designed for conflict.
* * * * *
ARMY.
Synonyms:
armament, forces, military, soldiers, array, host, multitude, soldiery, force, legions, phalanx, troops.
An army is an organized body of men armed for war, ordinarily considerable in numbers, always independent
in organization so far as not to be a constituent part of any other command. Organization, unity, and
independence, rather than numbers are the essentials of an army. We speak of the invading army of Cortes or
Pizarro, tho either body was contemptible in numbers from a modern military standpoint. We may have a little
army, a large army, or a vast army. Host is used for any vast and orderly assemblage; as, the stars are called
the heavenly host. Multitude expresses number without order or organization; a multitude of armed men is not
an army, but a mob. Legion (from the Latin) and phalanx (from the Greek) are applied by a kind of poetic
license to modern forces; the plural legions is preferred to the singular. Military is a general word for
land-forces; the military may include all the armed soldiery of a nation, or the term may be applied to any
small detached company, as at a fort, in distinction from civilians. Any organized body of men by whom the
law or will of a people is executed is a force; the word is a usual term for the police of any locality.
* * * * *
ARRAIGN.
Synonyms:
accuse, charge, impeach, prosecute, censure, cite, indict, summon.
Arraign is an official word; a person accused of crime is arraigned when he is formally called into court, the
indictment read to him, and the demand made of him to plead guilty or not guilty; in more extended use, to
arraign is to call in question for fault in any formal, public, or official way. One may charge another with any
fault, great or trifling, privately or publicly, formally or informally. Accuse is stronger than charge, suggesting
more of the formal and criminal; a person may charge a friend with unkindness or neglect; he may accuse a
tramp of stealing. Censure carries the idea of fault, but not of crime; it may be private and individual, or
52
public and official. A judge, a president, or other officer of high rank may be impeached before the
appropriate tribunal for high crimes; the veracity of a witness may be impeached by damaging evidence. A
person of the highest character may be summoned as defendant in a civil suit; or he may be cited to answer as
administrator, etc. Indict and arraign apply strictly to criminal proceedings, and only an alleged criminal is
indicted or arraigned. One is indicted by the grand jury, and arraigned before the appropriate court.
Antonyms:
acquit, discharge, exonerate, overlook, release, condone, excuse, forgive, pardon, set free.
Prepositions:
Arraign at the bar, before the tribunal, of or for a crime; on or upon an indictment.
* * * * *
ARRAY.
Synonyms:
army, collection, line of battle, parade, arrangement, disposition, order, show, battle array, exhibition, order of
battle, sight.
The phrase battle array or array of battle is archaic and poetic; we now say in line or order of battle. The
parade is for exhibition and oversight, and partial rehearsal of military manual and maneuvers. Array refers to
a continuous arrangement of men, so that all may be seen or reviewed at once. This is practically impossible
with the vast armies of our day. We say rather the disposition of troops, which expresses their location so as to
sustain and support, though unable to see or readily communicate with each other. Compare DRESS.
* * * * *
ARREST.
Synonyms:
apprehend, detain, restrain, stop, capture, hold, secure, take into custody, catch, make prisoner, seize, take
prisoner.
The legal term arrest carries always the implication of a legal offense; this is true even of arresting for debt.
But one may be detained by process of law when no offense is alleged against him, as in the case of a witness
who is held in a house of detention till a case comes to trial. One may be restrained of his liberty without
arrest, as in an insane asylum; an individual or corporation may be restrained by injunction from selling
certain property. In case of an arrest, an officer may secure his prisoner by fetters, by a locked door, or other
means effectually to prevent escape. Capture is commonly used of seizure by armed force; as, to capture a
ship, a fort, etc. Compare HINDER; OBSTRUCT.
Antonyms:
discharge, dismiss, free, liberate, release, set free.
Prepositions:
53
Arrested for crime, on suspicion, by the sheriff; on, upon, or by virtue of a warrant; on final process; in
execution.
* * * * *
ARTIFICE.
Synonyms:
art, craft, finesse, invention, stratagem, blind, cunning, fraud, machination, subterfuge, cheat, device, guile,
maneuver, trick, contrivance, dodge, imposture, ruse, wile.
A contrivance or device may be either good or bad. A cheat is a mean advantage in a bargain; a fraud, any
form of covert robbery or injury. Imposture is a deceitful contrivance for securing charity, credit, or
consideration. A stratagem or maneuver may be of the good against the bad, as it were a skilful movement of
war. A wile is usually but not necessarily evil.
E'en children followed with endearing wile.
GOLDSMITH Deserted Village, l. 184.
A trick is often low, injurious, and malicious; we say a mean trick; the word is sometimes used playfully with
less than its full meaning. A ruse or a blind may be quite innocent and harmless. An artifice is a carefully and
delicately prepared contrivance for doing indirectly what one could not well do directly. A device is
something studied out for promoting an end, as in a mechanism; the word is used of indirect action, often, but
not necessarily directed to an evil, selfish, or injurious end. Finesse is especially subtle contrivance, delicate
artifice, whether for good or evil. Compare FRAUD.
Antonyms:
artlessness, frankness, ingenuousness, openness, sincerity, candor, guilelessness, innocence, simplicity, truth.
fairness, honesty,
* * * * *
ARTIST.
Synonyms:
artificer, artisan, mechanic, operative, workman.
Artist, artificer and artisan are all from the root of art, but artist holds to the esthetic sense, while artificer and
artisan follow the mechanical or industrial sense of the word (see ART under SCIENCE). Artist thus comes
only into accidental association with the other words of this group, not being a synonym of any one of them
and having practically no synonym of its own. The work of the artist is creative; that of the artisan
mechanical. The man who paints a beautiful picture is an artist; the man who makes pin-heads all day is an
artisan. The artificer is between the two, putting more thought, intelligence, and taste into his work than the
artisan, but less of the idealizing, creative power than the artist. The sculptor, shaping his model in clay, is
artificer, as well as artist; patient artisans, working simply by rule and scale, chisel and polish the stone. The
man who constructs anything by mere routine and rule is a mechanic. The man whose work involves thought,
skill, and constructive power is an artificer. The hod-carrier is a laborer; the bricklayer is a mechanic; the
master mason is an artificer. Those who operate machinery nearly self-acting are operatives.
54
* * * * *
ASK.
Synonyms:
beg, crave, entreat, petition, request, solicit, beseech, demand, implore, pray, require, supplicate.
One asks what he feels that he may fairly claim and reasonably expect; "if a son shall ask bread of any of you
that is a father," Luke xi, 11; he begs for that to which he advances no claim but pity. Demand is a determined
and often an arrogant word; one may rightfully demand what is his own or his due, when it is withheld or
denied; or he may wrongfully demand that to which he has no claim but power. Require is less arrogant and
obtrusive than demand, but is exceedingly strenuous; as, the court requires the attendance of witnesses.
Entreat implies a special earnestness of asking, and beseech, a still added and more humble intensity; beseech
was formerly often used as a polite intensive for beg or pray; as, I beseech you to tell me. To implore is to ask
with weeping and lamentation; to supplicate is to ask, as it were, on bended knees. Crave and request are
somewhat formal terms; crave has almost disappeared from conversation; request would seem distant
between parent and child. Pray is now used chiefly of address to the Supreme Being; petition is used of
written request to persons in authority; as, to petition the legislature to pass an act, or the governor to pardon
an offender.
Antonyms:
claim, deny, enforce, exact, extort, insist, refuse, reject. command,
Prepositions:
Ask a person for a thing; ask a thing of or from a person; ask after or about one's health, welfare, friends, etc.
* * * * *
ASSOCIATE.
Synonyms:
accomplice, coadjutor, comrade, fellow, mate, ally, colleague, confederate, friend, partner, chum, companion,
consort, helpmate, peer.
An associate as used officially implies a chief, leader, or principal, to whom the associate is not fully equal in
rank. Associate is popularly used of mere friendly relations, but oftener implies some work, enterprise, or
pursuit in which the associated persons unite. We rarely speak of associates in crime or wrong, using
confederates or accomplices instead. Companion gives itself with equal readiness to the good or evil sense, as
also does comrade. One may be a companion in travel who would not readily become an associate at home. A
lady advertises for a companion; she would not advertise for an associate. Peer implies equality rather than
companionship; as, a jury of his peers. Comrade expresses more fellowship and good feeling than companion.
Fellow has almost gone out of use in this connection, except in an inferior or patronizing sense. Consort is a
word of equality and dignity, as applied especially to the marriage relation. Compare ACCESSORY;
ACQUAINTANCE; FRIENDSHIP.
Antonyms:
antagonist, foe, hinderer, opponent, opposer, rival, stranger. enemy,
55
Prepositions:
These were the associates of the leader in the enterprise.
* * * * *
ASSOCIATION.
Synonyms:
alliance, confederacy, familiarity, lodge, club, confederation, federation, participation, community,
conjunction, fellowship, partnership, companionship, connection, fraternity, society, company, corporation,
friendship, union.
We speak of an alliance of nations, a club of pleasure-seekers, a community of Shakers, a company of soldiers
or of friends, a confederacy, confederation, federation, or union of separate states under one general
government, a partnership or company of business men, a conjunction of planets. The whole body of
Freemasons constitute a fraternity; one of their local organizations is called a lodge. A corporation or
company is formed for purposes of business; an association or society (tho also incorporated) is for learning,
literature, benevolence, religion, etc. Compare ASSOCIATE; ACQUAINTANCE; FRIENDSHIP.
Antonyms:
disintegration, independence, isolation, separation, solitude.
Prepositions:
An association of scholars for the advancement of knowledge; association with the good is ennobling.
* * * * *
ASSUME.
Synonyms:
accept, arrogate, postulate, put on, affect, claim, presume, take, appropriate, feign, pretend, usurp.
The distinctive idea of assume is to take by one's own independent volition, whether well or ill, rightfully or
wrongfully. One may accept an obligation or assume an authority that properly belongs to him, or he may
assume an obligation or indebtedness that could not be required of him. He may assume authority or office
that is his right; if he assumes what does not belong to him, he is said to arrogate or usurp it. A man may
usurp the substance of power in the most unpretending way; what he arrogates to himself he assumes with a
haughty and overbearing manner. One assumes the robes or insignia of office by putting them on, with or
without right. If he takes to himself the credit and appearance of qualities he does not possess, he is said to
affect or feign, or to pretend to, the character he thus assumes. What a debater postulates he openly states and
takes for granted without proof; what he assumes he may take for granted without mention. A favorite trick of
the sophist is quietly to assume as true what would at once be challenged if expressly stated. What a man
claims he asserts his right to take; what he assumes he takes.
* * * * *
ASSURANCE.
56
Synonyms:
arrogance, boldness, impudence, self-confidence, assertion, confidence, presumption, self-reliance,
assumption, effrontery, self-assertion, trust.
Assurance may have the good sense of a high, sustained confidence and trust; as, the saint's assurance of
heaven. Confidence is founded upon reasons; assurance is largely a matter of feeling. In the bad sense,
assurance is a vicious courage, with belief of one's ability to outwit or defy others; the hardened criminal is
remarkable for habitual assurance. For the calm conviction of one's own rectitude and ability, self-confidence
is a better word than assurance; self-reliance expresses confidence in one's own resources, independently of
others' aid. In the bad sense assurance is less gross than impudence, which is (according to its etymology) a
shameless boldness. Assurance is in act or manner; impudence may be in speech. Effrontery is impudence
defiantly displayed. Compare FAITH; PRIDE.
Antonyms:
bashfulness, consternation, distrust, hesitancy, shyness, confusion, dismay, doubt, misgiving, timidity.
* * * * *
ASTUTE.
Synonyms:
acute, discerning, penetrating, sharp, clear-sighted, discriminating, penetrative, shrewd, crafty, keen,
perspicacious, subtile, cunning, knowing, sagacious, subtle.
Acute, from the Latin, suggests the sharpness of the needle's point; keen, from the Saxon, the sharpness of the
cutting edge. Astute, from the Latin, with the original sense of cunning has come to have a meaning that
combines the sense of acute or keen with that of sagacious. The astute mind adds to acuteness and keenness
an element of cunning or finesse. The astute debater leads his opponents into a snare by getting them to make
admissions, or urge arguments, of which he sees a result that they do not perceive. The acute, keen intellect
may take no special advantage of these qualities; the astute mind has always a point to make for itself, and
seldom fails to make it. A knowing look, air, etc., in general indicates practical knowledge with a touch of
shrewdness, and perhaps of cunning; in regard to some special matter, it indicates the possession of reserved
knowledge which the person could impart if he chose. Knowing has often a slightly invidious sense. We speak
of a knowing rascal, meaning cunning or shrewd within a narrow range, but of a knowing horse or dog, in the
sense of sagacious, implying that he knows more than could be expected of such an animal. A knowing child
has more knowledge than would be looked for at his years, perhaps more than is quite desirable, while to
speak of a child as intelligent is altogether complimentary.
Antonyms:
blind, idiotic, shallow, stolid, undiscerning, dull, imbecile, short-sighted, stupid, unintelligent.
* * * * *
ATTACHMENT.
Synonyms:
adherence, devotion, friendship, regard, adhesion, esteem, inclination, tenderness, affection, estimation, love,
57
union.
An attachment is a feeling that binds a person by ties of heart to another person or thing; we speak of a man's
adherence to his purpose, his adhesion to his party, or to anything to which he clings tenaciously, tho with no
special tenderness; of his attachment to his church, to the old homestead, or to any persons or objects that he
may hold dear. Affection expresses more warmth of feeling; we should not speak of a mother's attachment to
her babe, but of her affection or of her devotion. Inclination expresses simply a tendency, which may be good
or bad, yielded to or overcome; as, an inclination to study; an inclination to drink. Regard is more distant than
affection or attachment, but closer and warmer than esteem; we speak of high esteem, kind regard. Compare
ACQUAINTANCE; APPENDAGE; FRIENDSHIP; LOVE; UNION.
Antonyms:
alienation, aversion, distance, estrangement, repugnance, animosity, coolness, divorce, indifference,
separation, antipathy, dislike, enmity, opposition, severance.
Prepositions:
Attachment of a true man to his friends; attachment to a leader for his nobility of character; the attachments
between two persons or things; attachment by muscular fibers, or by a rope, etc.
* * * * *
ATTACK, v.
Synonyms:
assail, beset, combat, invade, assault, besiege, encounter, set upon, beleaguer, charge, fall upon, storm.
To attack is to begin hostilities of any kind. A general invades a country by marching in troops; he attacks a
city by drawing up an army against it; he assaults it by hurling his troops directly upon its defenses. Assail
and assault, tho of the same original etymology, have diverged in meaning, so that assault alone retains the
meaning of direct personal violence. One may assail another with reproaches; he assaults him with a blow, a
brandished weapon, etc. Armies or squadrons charge; combat and encounter may be said of individual
contests. To beset is to set around, or, so to speak, to stud one's path, with menaces, attacks, or persuasions.
To besiege and beleaguer are the acts of armies. To encounter is to meet face to face, and may be said either
of the attacking or of the resisting force or person, or of both.
Antonyms:
aid, cover, protect, shelter, support, uphold, befriend, defend, resist, shield, sustain, withstand.
Prepositions:
We were attacked by the enemy with cannon and musketry.
* * * * *
ATTACK, n.
Synonyms:
58
aggression, incursion, invasion, onslaught, assault, infringement, onset, trespass. encroachment, intrusion,
An attack may be by word; an aggression is always by deed. An assault may be upon the person, an
aggression is upon rights, possessions, etc. An invasion of a nation's territories is an act of aggression; an
intrusion upon a neighboring estate is a trespass. Onslaught signifies intensely violent assault, as by an army
or a desperado, tho it is sometimes used of violent speech.
Antonyms:
defense, repulsion, resistance, retreat, submission, surrender.
Prepositions:
The enemy made an attack upon (or on) our works.
* * * * *
ATTAIN.
Synonyms:
accomplish, arrive at, gain, master, reach, achieve, compass, get, obtain, secure, acquire, earn, grasp, procure,
win.
A person may obtain a situation by the intercession of friends, he procures a dinner by paying for it. Attain is
a lofty word, pointing to some high or desirable result; a man attains the mountain summit, he attains honor
or learning as the result of strenuous and earnest labor. Even that usage of attain which has been thought to
refer to mere progress of time carries the thought of a result desired; as, to attain to old age; the man desires to
live to a good old age; we should not speak of his attaining his dotage. One may attain an object that will
prove not worth his labor, but what he achieves is in itself great and splendid; as, the Greeks at Marathon
achieved a glorious victory. Compare DO; GET; REACH.
Antonyms:
abandon, fail, forfeit, give up, let go, lose, miss.
* * * * *
ATTITUDE.
Synonyms:
pose, position, posture.
Position as applied to the arrangement or situation of the human body or limbs may denote that which is
conscious or unconscious, of the living or the dead; but we do not speak of the attitude, pose, or posture of a
corpse; unless, in some rare case, we might say the body was found in a sitting posture, where the posture is
thought of as assumed in life, or as, at first glance, suggesting life. A posture is assumed without any special
reference to expression of feeling; as, an erect posture, a reclining posture; attitude is the position appropriate
to the expression of some feeling; the attitude may be unconsciously taken through the strength of the feeling;
as, an attitude of defiance; or it may be consciously assumed in the attempt to express the feeling; as, he
assumed an attitude of humility. A pose is a position studied for artistic effect, or considered with reference to
59
such effect; the unconscious posture of a spectator or listener may be an admirable pose from an artist's
standpoint.
* * * * *
ATTRIBUTE, v.
Synonyms:
ascribe, associate, connect, impute, refer. assign, charge,
We may attribute to a person either that which belongs to him or that which we merely suppose to be his. We
attribute to God infinite power. We may attribute a wrong intent to an innocent person. We may attribute a
result, rightly or wrongly, to a certain cause; in such case, however, attribute carries always a concession of
uncertainty or possible error. Where we are quite sure, we simply refer a matter to the cause or class to which
it belongs or ascribe to one what is surely his, etc. Many diseases formerly attributed to witchcraft are now
referred to the action of micro-organisms. We may attribute a matter in silent thought; we ascribe anything
openly in speech or writing; King Saul said of the singing women, "They have ascribed unto David ten
thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands." We associate things which may have no necessary or
causal relation; as, we may associate the striking of a clock with the serving of dinner, tho the two are not
necessarily connected. We charge a person with what we deem blameworthy. We may impute good or evil,
but more commonly evil.
Antonyms:
deny, disconnect, dissociate, separate, sever, sunder.
Prepositions:
It is uncharitable to attribute evil motives to (archaic unto) others.

ATTRIBUTE, n.
Synonyms:
property, quality.
A quality (L. qualis, such)--the "suchness" of anything, according to the German idiom--denotes what a thing
really is in some one respect; an attribute is what we conceive a thing to be in some one respect; thus, while
attribute may, quality must, express something of the real nature of that to which it is ascribed; we speak of
the attributes of God, the qualities of matter. "Originally 'the attributes of God' was preferred, probably,
because men assumed no knowledge of the actual qualities of the Deity, but only of those more or less fitly
attributed to him." J. A. H. MURRAY. [M.] Holiness is an attribute of God; the attributes of many heathen
deities have been only the qualities of wicked men joined to superhuman power. A property (L. proprius,
one's own) is what belongs especially to one thing as its own peculiar possession, in distinction from all other
things; when we speak of the qualities or the properties of matter, quality is the more general, property the
more limited term. A quality is inherent; a property may be transient; physicists now, however, prefer to term
those qualities manifested by all bodies (such as impenetrability, extension, etc.), general properties of
matter, while those peculiar to certain substances or to certain states of those substances (as fluidity,
malleability, etc.) are termed specific properties; in this wider use of the word property, it becomes strictly
60
synonymous with quality. Compare CHARACTERISTIC; EMBLEM.
Antonyms:
being, essence, nature, substance.
* * * * *
AUGUR.
Synonyms:
betoken, divine, foretell, predict, prognosticate, bode, forebode, portend, presage, prophesy.
"Persons or things augur; persons only forebode or presage; things only betoken or portend." CRABB English
Synonymes. We augur well for a voyage from past good fortune and a good start; we presage success from the
stanchness of the ship and the skill of the captain. We forebode misfortune either from circumstances that
betoken failure, or from gloomy fancies for which we could not give a reason. Dissipation among the officers
and mutiny among the crew portend disaster. Divine has reference to the ancient soothsayers' arts (as in Gen.
xliv, 5, 15), and refers rather to reading hearts than to reading the future. We say I could not divine his motive,
or his intention.
Antonyms:
assure, demonstrate, establish, make sure, settle, calculate, determine, insure, prove, warrant.
Prepositions:
I augur from all circumstances a prosperous result; I augur ill of the enterprise; "augurs ill to the rights of the
people," THOMAS JEFFERSON Writings vol. ii, p. 506. [T. & M. '53.] I augur well, or this augurs well, for
your cause.
* * * * *
AUTHENTIC.
Synonyms:
accepted, certain, original, sure, accredited, current, real, true, authoritative, genuine, received, trustworthy,
authorized, legitimate, reliable, veritable.
That is authentic which is true to the facts; that is genuine which is true to its own claims; as, authentic
history; genuine money.
A 'genuine' work is one written by the author whose name it bears; an 'authentic' work is one which relates
truthfully the matters of which it treats. For example, the apocryphal Gospel of St. Thomas is neither 'genuine'
nor 'authentic.' It is not 'genuine,' for St. Thomas did not write it; it is not 'authentic,' for its contents are
mainly fables and lies.
TRENCH On the Study of Words lect. vi, p. 189. [W. J. W.]
Authentic is, however, used by reputable writers as synonymous with genuine, tho usually where genuineness
61
carries a certain authority. We speak of accepted conclusions, certain evidence, current money, genuine
letters, a legitimate conclusion or legitimate authority, original manuscripts, real value, received
interpretation, sure proof, a true statement, a trustworthy witness, a veritable discovery.
Antonyms:
apocryphal, counterfeit, exploded, false, spurious, baseless, disputed, fabulous, fictitious, unauthorized.
* * * * *
AUXILIARY.
Synonyms:
accessory, ally, coadjutor, helper, promoter, aid, assistant, confederate, mercenary, subordinate.
An auxiliary is a person or thing that helps in a subordinate capacity. Allies unite as equals; auxiliaries are, at
least technically, inferiors or subordinates. Yet the auxiliary is more than a mere assistant. The word is
oftenest found in the plural, and in the military sense; auxiliaries are troops of one nation uniting with the
armies, and acting under the orders, of another. Mercenaries serve only for pay; auxiliaries often for reasons
of state, policy, or patriotism as well. Compare ACCESSORY; APPENDAGE.
Antonyms:
antagonist, hinderer, opponent, opposer.
Prepositions:
The auxiliaries of the Romans; an auxiliary in a good cause; an auxiliary to learning.
* * * * *
AVARICIOUS.
Synonyms:
close, greedy, niggardly, penurious, sordid, covetous, miserly, parsimonious, rapacious, stingy.
Avaricious and covetous refer especially to acquisition, miserly, niggardly, parsimonious, and penurious to
expenditure. The avaricious man has an eager craving for money, and ordinarily desires both to get and to
keep, the covetous man to get something away from its possessor; tho one may be made avaricious by the
pressure of great expenditures. Miserly and niggardly persons seek to gain by mean and petty savings; the
miserly by stinting themselves, the niggardly by stinting others. Parsimonious and penurious may apply to
one's outlay either for himself or for others; in the latter use, they are somewhat less harsh and reproachful
terms than niggardly. The close man holds like a vise all that he gets. Near and nigh are provincial words of
similar import. The rapacious have the robber instinct, and put it in practise in some form, as far as they dare.
The avaricious and rapacious are ready to reach out for gain; the parsimonious, miserly, and niggardly prefer
the safer and less adventurous way of avoiding expenditure. Greedy and stingy are used not only of money,
but often of other things, as food, etc. The greedy child wishes to enjoy everything himself; the stingy child, to
keep others from getting it.
Antonyms:
62
bountiful, free, generous, liberal, munificent, prodigal, wasteful.
Preposition:
The monarch was avaricious of power.
* * * * *
AVENGE.
Synonyms:
punish, retaliate, revenge, vindicate, visit.
Avenge and revenge, once close synonyms, are now far apart in meaning. To avenge is to visit some offense
with punishment, in order to vindicate the righteous, or to uphold and illustrate the right by the suffering or
destruction of the wicked. "And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he avenged him that was oppressed, and
smote the Egyptian," Acts vii, 24. To revenge is to inflict harm or suffering upon another through personal
anger and resentment at something done to ourselves. Avenge is unselfish; revenge is selfish. Revenge,
according to present usage, could not be said of God. To retaliate may be necessary for self-defense, without
the idea of revenge. Compare REVENGE.
Prepositions:
Avenge on or upon (rarely, avenge oneself of) a wrong-doer.
* * * * *
AVOW.
Synonyms:
knowledge, aver, confess, own, profess, testify, admit, avouch, declare, proclaim, protest, witness.
Acknowledge, admit, and declare refer either to oneself or to others; all the other words refer only to one's
own knowledge or action. To avow is to declare boldly and openly, commonly as something one is ready to
justify, maintain, or defend. A man acknowledges another's claim or his own promise; he admits an opponent's
advantage or his own error; he declares either what he has seen or experienced or what he has received from
another; he avers what he is sure of from his own knowledge or consciousness; he gives his assurance as the
voucher for what he avouches; he avows openly a belief or intention that he has silently held. Avow and
avouch take a direct object; aver is followed by a conjunction: a man avows his faith, avouches a deed, avers
that he was present. Avow has usually a good sense; what a person avows he at least does not treat as
blameworthy, criminal, or shameful; if he did, he would be said to confess it; yet there is always the
suggestion that some will be ready to challenge or censure what one avows; as, the clergyman avowed his
dissent from the doctrine of his church. Own applies to all things, good or bad, great or small, which one takes
as his own. Compare CONFESS; STATE.
Antonyms:
contradict, deny, disavow, disclaim, disown, ignore, repudiate.
* * * * *
63
AWFUL.
Synonyms:
alarming, direful, frightful, majestic, solemn, appalling, dread, grand, noble, stately, august, dreadful, horrible,
portentous, terrible, dire, fearful, imposing, shocking, terrific.
Awful should not be used of things which are merely disagreeable or annoying, nor of all that are alarming
and terrible, but only of such as bring a solemn awe upon the soul, as in the presence of a superior power; as,
the awful hush before the battle. That which is awful arouses an oppressive, that which is august an admiring
reverence; we speak of the august presence of a mighty monarch, the awful presence of death. We speak of an
exalted station, a grand mountain, an imposing presence, a majestic cathedral, a noble mien, a solemn litany, a
stately march, an august assembly, the awful scene of the Judgment Day.
Antonyms:
base, contemptible, inferior, paltry, beggarly, despicable, lowly, undignified, commonplace, humble, mean,
vulgar.
* * * * *
AWKWARD.
Synonyms:
boorish, clumsy, rough, unhandy, bungling, gawky, uncouth, unskilful. clownish, maladroit, ungainly,
Awkward, from awk (kindred with off, from the Norwegian), is off-ward, turned the wrong way; it was
anciently used of a back-handed or left-handed blow in battle, of squinting eyes, etc. Clumsy, on the other
hand (from clumse, also through the Norwegian), signifies benumbed, stiffened with cold; this is the original
meaning of clumsy fingers, clumsy limbs. Thus, awkward primarily refers to action, clumsy to condition. A
tool, a vehicle, or the human frame may be clumsy in shape or build, awkward in motion. The clumsy man is
almost of necessity awkward, but the awkward man may not be naturally clumsy. The finest untrained colt is
awkward in harness; a horse that is clumsy in build can never be trained out of awkwardness. An awkward
statement has an uncomfortable, and perhaps recoiling force; a statement that contains ill-assorted and
incongruous material in ill-chosen language is clumsy. We speak of an awkward predicament, an awkward
scrape. An awkward excuse commonly reflects on the one who offers it. We say the admitted facts have an
awkward appearance. In none of these cases could clumsy be used. Clumsy is, however, applied to movements
that seem as unsuitable as those of benumbed and stiffened limbs. A dancing bear is both clumsy and
awkward.
Antonyms:
adroit, clever, dexterous, handy, skilful.
Prepositions:
The raw recruit is awkward in action; at the business.
* * * * *
AXIOM.
64
Synonym:
truism.
Both the axiom and the truism are instantly seen to be true, and need no proof; but in an axiom there is
progress of thought, while the truism simply says the same thing over again, or says what is too manifest to
need saying. The axiom that "things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another" unfolds in the
latter part of the sentence the truth implied in the first part, which might have been overlooked if not stated. In
the truism that "a man can do all he is capable of," the former and the latter part of the sentence are simply
identical, and the mind is left just where it started. Hence the axiom is valuable and useful, while the truism is
weak and flat, unless the form of statement makes it striking or racy, as "all fools are out of their wits."
Compare PROVERB.
Antonyms:
absurdity, contradiction, demonstration, nonsense, paradox, sophism.
* * * * *
BABBLE.
Synonyms:
blab, cackle, gabble, murmur, prattle, blurt, chat, gossip, palaver, tattle, blurt out, chatter, jabber, prate,
twaddle.
Most of these words are onomatopoetic. The cackle of a hen, the gabble of a goose, the chatter of a magpie,
the babble of a running stream, as applied to human speech, indicate a rapid succession of what are to the
listener meaningless sounds. Blab and blurt (commonly blurt out) refer to the letting out of what the lips can
no longer keep in; blab, of a secret; blurt out, of passionate feeling. To chat is to talk in an easy, pleasant way,
not without sense, but without special purpose. Chatting is the practise of adults, prattling that of children. To
prate is to talk idly, presumptuously, or foolishly, but not necessarily incoherently. To jabber is to utter a
rapid succession of unintelligible sounds, generally more noisy than chattering. To gossip is to talk of petty
personal matters, as for pastime or mischief. To twaddle is to talk feeble nonsense. To murmur is to utter
suppressed or even inarticulate sounds, suggesting the notes of a dove, or the sound of a running stream, and
is used figuratively of the half suppressed utterances of affection or pity, or of complaint, resentment, etc.
Compare SPEAK.
Prepositions:
Babies babble for the moon; the crowd babbles of a hero; the sick man babbles of home.
* * * * *
BANISH.
Synonyms:
ban, dismiss, evict, expatriate, ostracize, discharge, drive out, exile, expel, oust. dislodge, eject,
Banish, primarily to put under ban, to compel by authority to leave a place or country, perhaps with restriction
to some other place or country. From a country, a person may be banished, exiled, or expatriated; banished
65
from any country where he may happen to be, but expatriated or exiled only from his own. One may
expatriate or exile himself; he is banished by others. Banish is a word of wide import; one may banish
disturbing thoughts; care may banish sleep. To expel is to drive out with violence or rudeness, and so often
with disgrace.
Prepositions:
Cataline was banished from Rome; John the Apostle was banished to Patmos.
* * * * *
BANK.
Synonyms:
beach, bound, brink, edge, margin, shore, border, brim, coast, marge, rim, strand.
Bank is a general term for the land along the edge of a water course; it may also denote a raised portion of the
bed of a river, lake, or ocean; as, the Banks of Newfoundland. A beach is a strip or expanse of incoherent
wave-worn sand, which is often pebbly or full of boulders; we speak of the beach of a lake or ocean; a beach
is sometimes found in the bend of a river. Strand is a more poetic term for a wave-washed shore, especially as
a place for landing or embarking; as, the keel grates on the strand. The whole line of a country or continent
that borders the sea is a coast. Shore is any land, whether cliff, or sand, or marsh, bordering water. We do not
speak of the coast of a river, nor of the banks of the ocean, tho there may be banks by or under the sea. Edge
is the line where land and water meet; as, the water's edge. Brink is the place from which one may fall; as, the
river's brink; the brink of a precipice; the brink of ruin.
* * * * *
BANTER.
Synonyms:
badinage, derision, jeering, raillery, sarcasm, chaff, irony, mockery, ridicule, satire.
Banter is the touching upon some fault, weakness, or fancied secret of another in a way half to pique and half
to please; badinage is delicate, refined banter. Raillery has more sharpness, but is usually good-humored and
well meant. Irony, the saying one thing that the reverse may be understood, may be either mild or bitter. All
the other words have a hostile intent. Ridicule makes a person or thing the subject of contemptuous
merriment; derision seeks to make the object derided seem utterly despicable--to laugh it to scorn. Chaff is the
coarse witticism of the streets, perhaps merry, oftener malicious; jeering is loud, rude ridicule, as of a hostile
crowd or mob. Mockery is more studied, and may include mimicry and personal violence, as well as scornful
speech. A satire is a formal composition; a sarcasm may be an impromptu sentence. The satire shows up
follies to keep people from them; the sarcasm hits them because they are foolish, without inquiring whether it
will do good or harm; the satire is plainly uttered; the sarcasm is covert.
* * * * *
BARBAROUS.
Synonyms:
66
atrocious, brutal, merciless, uncivilized, barbarian, cruel, rude, uncouth, barbaric, inhuman, savage, untamed.
Whatever is not civilized is barbarian; barbaric indicates rude magnificence, uncultured richness; as,
barbaric splendor, a barbaric melody. Barbarous refers to the worst side of barbarian life, and to revolting
acts, especially of cruelty, such as a civilized man would not be expected to do; as, a barbarous deed. We
may, however, say barbarous nations, barbarous tribes, without implying anything more than want of
civilization and culture. Savage is more distinctly bloodthirsty than barbarous. In this sense we speak of a
savage beast and of barbarous usage.
Antonyms:
civilized, cultured, elegant, humane, polite, tender, courtly, delicate, graceful, nice, refined, urbane.
* * * * *
BARRIER.
Synonyms:
bar, bulwark, obstruction, rampart, barricade, hindrance, parapet, restraint, breastwork, obstacle, prohibition,
restriction.
A bar is something that is or may be firmly fixed, ordinarily with intent to prevent entrance or egress; as, the
bars of a prison cell; the bars of a wood-lot. A barrier obstructs, but is not necessarily impassable. Barrier is
used of objects more extensive than those to which bar is ordinarily applied. A mountain range may be a
barrier to exploration; but a mass of sand across the entrance to a harbor is called a bar. Discovered falsehood
is a bar to confidence. Barricade has become practically a technical name for an improvised street
fortification, and, unless in some way modified, is usually so understood. A parapet is a low or breast-high
wall, as about the edge of a roof, terrace, etc., especially, in military use, such a wall for the protection of
troops; a rampart is the embankment surrounding a fort, on which the parapet is raised; the word rampart is
often used as including the parapet. Bulwark is a general word for any defensive wall or rampart; its only
technical use at present is in nautical language, where it signifies the raised side of a ship above the upper
deck, topped by the rail. Compare BOUNDARY; IMPEDIMENT.
Antonyms:
admittance, opening, road, transit, entrance, passage, thoroughfare, way.
Prepositions:
A barrier to progress, against invasion; a barrier between nations.
* * * * *
BATTLE.
Synonyms:
action, combat, encounter, passage of arms, affair, conflict, engagement, skirmish, bout, contest, fight, strife.
Conflict is a general word which describes opponents, whether individuals or hosts, as dashed together. One
continuous conflict between entire armies is a battle. Another battle may be fought upon the same field after a
67
considerable interval; or a new battle may follow immediately, the armies meeting upon a new field. An
action is brief and partial; a battle may last for days. Engagement is a somewhat formal expression for battle;
as, it was the commander's purpose to avoid a general engagement. A protracted war, including many battles,
may be a stubborn contest. Combat, originally a hostile encounter between individuals, is now used also for
extensive engagements. A skirmish is between small detachments or scattered troops. An encounter may be
either purposed or accidental, between individuals or armed forces. Fight is a word of less dignity than battle;
we should not ordinarily speak of Waterloo as a fight, unless where the word is used in the sense of fighting;
as, I was in the thick of the fight.
Antonyms:
armistice, concord, peace, suspension of hostilities, truce.
Prepositions:
A battle of giants; battle between armies; a battle for life, against invaders; a battle to the death; the battle of
(more rarely at) Marathon.
* * * * *
BEAT.
Synonyms:
bastinado, chastise, overcome, spank, thrash, batter, conquer, pommel, strike, vanquish, belabor, cudgel,
pound, surpass, whip, bruise, defeat, scourge, switch, worst. castigate, flog, smite,
Strike is the word for a single blow; to beat is to strike repeatedly, as a bird beats the air with its wings. Others
of the above words describe the manner of beating, as bastinado, to beat on the soles of the feet; belabor, to
inflict a comprehensive and exhaustive beating; cudgel, to beat with a stick; thrash, as wheat was beaten out
with the old hand-flail; to pound (akin to L. pondus, a weight) is to beat with a heavy, and pommel with a
blunt, instrument. To batter and to bruise refer to the results of beating; that is battered which is broken or
defaced by repeated blows on the surface (compare synonyms for SHATTER); that is bruised which has
suffered even one severe contusion. The metaphorical sense of beat, however, so far preponderates that one
may be very badly bruised and battered, and yet not be said to be beaten, unless he has got the worst of the
beating. To beat a combatant is to disable or dishearten him for further fighting. Hence beat becomes the
synonym for every word which implies getting the advantage of another. Compare CONQUER.
Antonyms:
fail, fall, get the worst of, go down, go under, surrender.
Almost all antonyms in this class are passive, and can be formed indefinitely from the conquering words by
the use of the auxiliary be; as, be beaten, be defeated, be conquered, etc.
Prepositions:
Beat with a stick over the head; beat by a trick; out of town; beat to the ground; into submission.
* * * * *
BEAUTIFUL.
68
Synonyms:
attractive, charming, exquisite, handsome, beauteous, comely, fair, lovely, bewitching, delightful, fine,
picturesque, bonny, elegant, graceful, pretty.
The definition of beauty, "perfection of form," is a good key to the meaning of beautiful, if we understand
"form" in its widest sense. There must also be harmony and unity, and in human beings spiritual loveliness, to
constitute an object or a person really beautiful. Thus, we speak of a beautiful landscape, a beautiful poem.
But beautiful implies also, in concrete objects, softness of outline and delicacy of mold; it is opposed to all
that is hard and rugged, hence we say a beautiful woman, but not a beautiful man. Beautiful has the further
limit of not transcending our powers of appreciation. Pretty expresses in a far less degree that which is
pleasing to a refined taste in objects comparatively small, slight, and dainty; as, a pretty bonnet; a pretty girl.
That is handsome which is not only superficially pleasing, but well and harmoniously proportioned, with
usually the added idea that it is made so by art, breeding, or training; as, a handsome horse; a handsome
house. Handsome is a term far inferior to beautiful; we may even say a handsome villain. Fair denotes what is
bright, smooth, clear, and without blemish; as, a fair face. The word applies wholly to what is superficial; we
can say "fair, yet false." In a specific sense, fair has the sense of blond, as opposed to dark or brunette. One
who possesses vivacity, wit, good nature, or other pleasing qualities may be attractive without beauty. Comely
denotes an aspect that is smooth, genial, and wholesome, with a certain fulness of contour and pleasing
symmetry, tho falling short of the beautiful; as, a comely matron. That is picturesque which would make a
striking picture.
Antonyms:
awkward, frightful, grotesque, repulsive, uncouth, clumsy, ghastly, hideous, shocking, ungainly, deformed,
grim, horrid, ugly, unlovely, disgusting, grisly, odious, unattractive, unpleasant.
Prepositions:
Beautiful to the eye; beautiful in appearance, in spirit; "beautiful for situation," Ps. xlviii, 2; beautiful of
aspect, of its kind.
* * * * *
BECAUSE.
Synonyms:
as, for, inasmuch as, since.
Because, literally by-cause, is the most direct and complete word for giving the reason of a thing. Since,
originally denoting succession in time, signifies a succession in a chain of reasoning, a natural inference or
result. As indicates something like, coordinate, parallel. Since is weaker than because; as is weaker than since;
either may introduce the reason before the main statement; thus, since or as you are going, I will accompany
you. Often the weaker word is the more courteous, implying less constraint; for example, as you request it, I
will come, rather than I will come because you request it. Inasmuch as is a formal and qualified expression,
implying by just so much, and no more; thus, inasmuch as the debtor has no property, I abandon the claim.
For is a loose connective, giving often mere suggestion or indication rather than reason or cause; as, it is
morning, for (not because) the birds are singing.
Antonyms:
69
altho, however, nevertheless, notwithstanding, yet.
Compare synonyms for BUT; NOTWITHSTANDING.
* * * * *
BECOMING.
Synonyms:
befitting, congruous, fit, meet, seemly, beseeming, decent, fitting, neat, suitable, comely, decorous, graceful,
proper, worthy.
That is becoming in dress which suits the complexion, figure, and other qualities of the wearer, so as to
produce on the whole a pleasing effect. That is decent which does not offend modesty or propriety. That is
suitable which is adapted to the age, station, situation, and other circumstances of the wearer; coarse, heavy
boots are suitable for farm-work; a juvenile style of dress is not suitable for an old lady. In conduct much the
same rules apply. The dignity and gravity of a patriarch would not be becoming to a child; at a funeral lively,
cheery sociability would not be decorous, while noisy hilarity would not be decent; sumptuous display would
not be suitable for a poor person. Fit is a compendious term for whatever fits the person, time, place,
occasion, etc.; as, a fit person; a fit abode; a fit place. Fitting, or befitting, is somewhat more elegant, implying
a nicer adaptation. Meet, a somewhat archaic word, expresses a moral fitness; as, meet for heaven. Compare
BEAUTIFUL.
Antonyms:
awkward, ill-fitting, indecent, unbecoming, unseemly, ill-becoming, improper, indecorous, unfit, unsuitable.
Prepositions:
The dress was becoming to the wearer. Such conduct was becoming in him.
* * * * *
BEGINNING.
Synonyms:
arising, inauguration, origin, source, commencement, inception, outset, spring, fount, initiation, rise, start.
fountain, opening,
The Latin commencement is more formal than the Saxon beginning, as the verb commence, is more formal
than begin. Commencement is for the most part restricted to some form of action, while beginning has no
restriction, but may be applied to action, state, material, extent, enumeration, or to whatever else may be
conceived of as having a first part, point, degree, etc. The letter A is at the beginning (not the commencement)
of every alphabet. If we were to speak of the commencement of the Pacific Railroad, we should be understood
to refer to the enterprise and its initiatory act; if we were to refer to the roadway we should say "Here is the
beginning of the Pacific Railroad." In the great majority of cases begin and beginning are preferable to
commence and commencement as the simple, idiomatic English words, always accurate and expressive. "In
the beginning was the word," John i, 1. An origin is the point from which something starts or sets out, often
involving, and always suggesting causal connection; as, the origin of evil; the origin of a nation, a
government, or a family. A source is that which furnishes a first and continuous supply, that which flows forth
70
freely or may be readily recurred to; as, the source of a river; a source of knowledge; a source of inspiration;
fertile land is a source (not an origin) of wealth. A rise is thought of as in an action; we say that a lake is the
source of a certain river, or that the river takes its rise from the lake. Motley wrote of "The Rise of the Dutch
Republic." Fount, fountain, and spring, in their figurative senses, keep close to their literal meaning. Compare
CAUSE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for END.
* * * * *
BEHAVIOR.
Synonyms:
action, breeding, conduct, deportment, manner, bearing, carriage, demeanor, life, manners.
Behavior is our action in the presence of others; conduct includes also that which is known only to ourselves
and our Maker. Carriage expresses simply the manner of holding the body, especially in sitting or walking, as
when it is said of a lady "she has a fine carriage." Bearing refers to the bodily expression of feeling or
disposition; as, a haughty bearing; a noble bearing. Demeanor is the bodily expression, not only of feelings,
but of moral states; as, a devout demeanor. Breeding, unless with some adverse limitation, denotes that
manner and conduct which result from good birth and training. Deportment is behavior as related to a set of
rules; as, the pupil's deportment was faultless. A person's manner may be that of a moment, or toward a single
person; his manners are his habitual style of behavior toward or before others, especially in matters of
etiquette and politeness; as, good manners are always pleasing.
Prepositions:
The behavior of the pastor to or toward his people, on or upon the streets, before the multitude, or in the
church, with the godly, or with the worldly, was alike faultless.
* * * * *
BEND.
Synonyms:
bias, curve, diverge, mold, submit, twist, bow, deflect, incline, persuade, turn, warp, crook, deviate, influence,
stoop, twine, yield.
In some cases a thing is spoken of as bent where the parts make an angle; but oftener to bend is understood to
be to draw to or through a curve; as, to bend a bow. To submit or yield is to bend the mind humbly to another's
wishes. To incline or influence is to bend another's wishes toward our own; to persuade is to draw them quite
over. To warp is to bend silently through the whole fiber, as a board in the sun. To crook is to bend
irregularly, as a crooked stick. Deflect, deviate, and diverge are said of any turning away; deviate commonly
of a slight and gradual movement, diverge of a more sharp and decided one. To bias is to cut across the
texture, or incline to one side; in figurative use always with an unfavorable import. Mold is a stronger work
than bend; we may bend by a superior force that which still resists the constraint; as, a bent bow; we mold
something plastic entirely to some desired form.

BENEVOLENCE.
Synonyms:
almsgiving, charity, kind-heartedness, munificence, beneficence, generosity, kindliness, philanthropy,
benignity, good-will, kindness, sympathy, bounty, humanity, liberality, unselfishness.
According to the etymology and original usage, beneficence is the doing well, benevolence the wishing or
willing well to others; but benevolence has come to include beneficence, and to displace it. We should not
now speak of benevolence which did not help, unless where there was no power to help; even then we should
rather say good-will or sympathy. Charity, which originally meant the purest love for God and man (as in 1
Cor. xiii), is now almost universally applied to some form of almsgiving, and is much more limited in
meaning than benevolence. Benignity suggests some occult power of blessing, such as was formerly ascribed
to the stars; we may say a good man has an air of benignity. Kindness and tenderness are personal;
benevolence and charity are general. Kindness extends to all sentient beings, whether men or animals, in
prosperity or in distress. Tenderness especially goes out toward the young, feeble, and needy, or even to the
dead. Humanity is so much kindness and tenderness toward man or beast as it would be inhuman not to have;
we say of some act of care or kindness, "common humanity requires it." Generosity is self-forgetful kindness
in disposition or action; it includes much besides giving; as, the generosity of forgiveness. Bounty applies to
ample giving, which on a larger scale is expressed by munificence. Liberality indicates broad, genial kindly
views, whether manifested in gifts or otherwise. We speak of the bounty of a generous host, the liberality or
munificence of the founder of a college, or of the liberality of a theologian toward the holders of conflicting
beliefs. Philanthropy applies to wide schemes for human welfare, often, but not always, involving large
expenditures in charity or benevolence. Compare MERCY.
Antonyms:
barbarity, greediness, ill-will, malignity, self-seeking, brutality, harshness, inhumanity, niggardliness,
stinginess, churlishness, illiberality, malevolence, selfishness, unkindness.
Prepositions:
Benevolence of, on the part of, or from the wealthy, to or toward the poor.

BIND.
Synonyms:
compel, fetter, oblige, restrict, shackle, engage, fix, restrain, secure, tie. fasten,
Binding is primarily by something flexible, as a cord or bandage drawn closely around an object or group of
objects, as when we bind up a wounded limb. We bind a sheaf of wheat with a cord; we tie the cord in a knot;
we fasten by any means that will make things hold together, as a board by nails, or a door by a lock. The verbs
tie and fasten are scarcely used in the figurative sense, tho, using the noun, we speak of the ties of affection.
Bind has an extensive figurative use. One is bound by conscience or honor; he is obliged by some imperious
necessity; engaged by his own promise; compelled by physical force or its moral equivalent.
Antonyms:
72
free, loose, set free, unbind, unfasten, unloose, untie.
Prepositions:
Bind to a pillar; unto an altar; to a service; bind one with chains or in chains; one is bound by a contract; a
splint is bound upon a limb; the arms may be bound to the sides or behind the back; bind a wreath about,
around, or round the head; twigs are bound in or into fagots; for military purposes, they are bound at both
ends and in the middle; one is bound by a contract, or bound under a penalty to fulfil a contract.

BITTER.
Synonyms:
acerb, acidulous, caustic, pungent, stinging, acetous, acrid, cutting, savage, tart, acid, acrimonious, harsh,
sharp, vinegarish, acidulated, biting, irate, sour, virulent.
Acid, sour, and bitter agree in being contrasted with sweet, but the two former are sharply distinguished from
the latter. Acid or sour is the taste of vinegar or lemon-juice; bitter that of quassia, quinine, or strychnine.
Acrid is nearly allied to bitter. Pungent suggests the effect of pepper or snuff on the organs of taste or smell;
as, a pungent odor. Caustic indicates the corroding effect of some strong chemical, as nitrate of silver. In a
figurative sense, as applied to language or character, these words are very closely allied. We say a sour face,
sharp words, bitter complaints, caustic wit, cutting irony, biting sarcasm, a stinging taunt, harsh judgment, a
tart reply. Harsh carries the idea of intentional and severe unkindness, bitter of a severity that arises from real
or supposed ill treatment. The bitter speech springs from the sore heart. Tart and sharp utterances may not
proceed from an intention to wound, but merely from a wit recklessly keen; cutting, stinging, and biting
speech indicates more or less of hostile intent, the latter being the more deeply malicious. The caustic
utterance is meant to burn, perhaps wholesomely, as in the satire of Juvenal or Cervantes. Compare
MOROSE.
Antonyms:
dulcet, honeyed, luscious, nectared, saccharine, sweet.
* * * * *
BLEACH, v.
Synonyms:
blanch, make white, whiten, whitewash.
To whiten is to make white in general, but commonly it means to overspread with white coloring-matter.
Bleach and blanch both signify to whiten by depriving of color, the former permanently, as linen; the latter
either permanently (as, to blanch celery) or temporarily (as, to blanch the cheek with fear). To whitewash is to
whiten superficially, especially by false approval.
Antonyms:
blacken, color, darken, dye, soil, stain.

BLEMISH.
Synonyms:
blot, defacement, disgrace, injury, spot, blur, defect, dishonor, reproach, stain, brand, deformity, fault, smirch,
stigma, crack, dent, flaw, soil, taint, daub, disfigurement, imperfection, speck, tarnish.
Whatever mars the beauty or completeness of an object is a blemish, whether original, as squinting eyes, or
the result of accident or disease, etc., as the pits of smallpox. A blemish is superficial; a flaw or taint is in
structure or substance. In the moral sense, we speak of a blot or stain upon reputation; a flaw or taint in
character. A defect is the want or lack of something; fault, primarily a failing, is something that fails of an
apparent intent or disappoints a natural expectation; thus a sudden dislocation or displacement of geological
strata is called a fault. Figuratively, a blemish comes from one's own ill-doing; a brand or stigma is inflicted
by others; as, the brand of infamy.
* * * * *
BLOW.
Synonyms:
box, concussion, disaster, misfortune, stripe, buffet, cuff, knock, rap, stroke, calamity, cut, lash, shock, thump.
A blow is a sudden impact, as of a fist or a club; a stroke is a sweeping movement; as, the stroke of a sword,
of an oar, of the arm in swimming. A shock is the sudden encounter with some heavy body; as, colliding
railway-trains meet with a shock; the shock of battle. A slap is given with the open hand, a lash with a whip,
thong, or the like; we speak also of the cut of a whip. A buffet or cuff is given only with the hand; a blow
either with hand or weapon. A cuff is a somewhat sidelong blow, generally with the open hand; as, a cuff or
box on the ear. A stripe is the effect or mark of a stroke. In the metaphorical sense, blow is used for sudden,
stunning, staggering calamity or sorrow; stroke for sweeping disaster, and also for sweeping achievement and
success. We say a stroke of paralysis, or a stroke of genius. We speak of the buffets of adverse fortune. Shock
is used of that which is at once sudden, violent, and prostrating; we speak of a shock of electricity, the shock
of an amputation, a shock of surprise. Compare BEAT.
* * * * *
BLUFF.
Synonyms:
abrupt, brusk, impolite, rough, blunt, coarse, inconsiderate, rude, blustering, discourteous, open, uncivil, bold,
frank, plain-spoken, unmannerly.
Bluff is a word of good meaning, as are frank and open. The bluff man talks and laughs loudly and freely, says
and does whatever he pleases with fearless good nature, and with no thought of annoying or giving pain to
others. The blunt man says things which he is perfectly aware are disagreeable, either from a defiant
indifference to others' feelings, or from the pleasure of tormenting.
Antonyms:
74
bland, genial, polished, polite, refined, reserved, urbane. courteous,
* * * * *
BODY.
Synonyms:
ashes, clay, dust, frame, system, carcass, corpse, form, remains, trunk.
Body denotes the entire physical structure, considered as a whole, of man or animal; form looks upon it as a
thing of shape and outline, perhaps of beauty; frame regards it as supported by its bony framework; system
views it as an assemblage of many related and harmonious organs. Body, form, frame, and system may be
either dead or living; clay and dust are sometimes so used in religious or poetic style, tho ordinarily these
words are used only of the dead. Corpse and remains are used only of the dead. Corpse is the plain technical
word for a dead body still retaining its unity; remains may be used after any lapse of time; the latter is also the
more refined and less ghastly term; as, friends are invited to view the remains. Carcass applies only to the
body of an animal, or of a human being regarded with contempt and loathing. Compare COMPANY.
Antonyms:
intellect, intelligence, mind, soul, spirit.
* * * * *
BOTH.
Synonyms:
twain, two.
Both refers to two objects previously mentioned, or had in mind, viewed or acting in connection; as, both men
fired at once; "two men fired" might mean any two, out of any number, and without reference to any previous
thought or mention. Twain is a nearly obsolete form of two. The two, or the twain, is practically equivalent to
both; both, however, expresses a closer unity. We would say both men rushed against the enemy; the two men
flew at each other. Compare EVERY.
Antonyms:
each, either, every, neither, none, no one, not any.
* * * * *
BOUNDARY.
Synonyms:
barrier, confines, limit, margin, border, edge, line, term, bound, enclosure, marches, termination, bourn,
frontier, marge, verge. bourne, landmark,
The boundary was originally the landmark, that which marked off one piece of territory from another. The
bound is the limit, marked or unmarked. Now, however, the difference between the two words has come to be
75
simply one of usage. As regards territory, we speak of the boundaries of a nation or of an estate; the bounds of
a college, a ball-ground, etc. Bounds may be used for all within the limits, boundary for the limiting line only.
Boundary looks to that which is without; bound only to that which is within. Hence we speak of the bounds,
not the boundaries, of a subject, of the universe, etc.; we say the students were forbidden to go beyond the
bounds. A barrier is something that bars ingress or egress. A barrier may be a boundary, as was the Great
Wall of China. Bourn, or bourne, is a poetical expression for bound or boundary. A border is a strip of land
along the boundary. Edge is a sharp terminal line, as where river or ocean meets the land. Limit is now used
almost wholly in the figurative sense; as, the limit of discussion, of time, of jurisdiction. Line is a military
term; as, within the lines, or through the lines, of an army. Compare BARRIER; END.
Antonyms:
center, citadel, estate, inside, interior, land, region, territory.
Prepositions:
The boundaries of an estate; the boundary between neighboring territories.
* * * * *
BRAVE.
Synonyms:
adventurous, courageous, fearless, undaunted, bold, daring, gallant, undismayed, chivalric, dauntless, heroic,
valiant, chivalrous, doughty, intrepid, venturesome.
The adventurous man goes in quest of danger; the bold man stands out and faces danger or censure; the brave
man combines confidence with resolution in presence of danger; the chivalrous man puts himself in peril for
others' protection. The daring step out to defy danger; the dauntless will not flinch before anything that may
come to them; the doughty will give and take limitless hard knocks. The adventurous find something romantic
in dangerous enterprises; the venturesome may be simply heedless, reckless, or ignorant. All great explorers
have been adventurous; children, fools, and criminals are venturesome. The fearless and intrepid possess
unshaken nerves in any place of danger. Courageous is more than brave, adding a moral element: the
courageous man steadily encounters perils to which he may be keenly sensitive, at the call of duty; the gallant
are brave in a dashing, showy, and splendid way; the valiant not only dare great dangers, but achieve great
results; the heroic are nobly daring and dauntless, truly chivalrous, sublimely courageous. Compare
FORTITUDE.
Antonyms:
afraid, cringing, fearful, pusillanimous, timid, cowardly, faint-hearted, frightened, shrinking, timorous.
* * * * *
BREAK.
Synonyms:
bankrupt, crack, destroy, rive, shatter, split, burst, crush, fracture, rupture, shiver, sunder, cashier, demolish,
rend, sever, smash, transgress.
76
To break is to divide sharply, with severance of particles, as by a blow or strain. To burst is to break by
pressure from within, as a bombshell, but it is used also for the result of violent force otherwise exerted; as, to
burst in a door, where the door yields as if to an explosion. To crush is to break by pressure from without, as
an egg-shell. To crack is to break without complete severance of parts; a cracked cup or mirror may still hold
together. Fracture has a somewhat similar sense. In a fractured limb, the ends of the broken bone may be
separated, tho both portions are still retained within the common muscular tissue. A shattered object is broken
suddenly and in numerous directions; as, a vase is shattered by a blow, a building by an earthquake. A
shivered glass is broken into numerous minute, needle-like fragments. To smash is to break thoroughly to
pieces with a crashing sound by some sudden act of violence; a watch once smashed will scarcely be worth
repair. To split is to cause wood to crack or part in the way of the grain, and is applied to any other case where
a natural tendency to separation is enforced by an external cause; as, to split a convention or a party. To
demolish is to beat down, as a mound, building, fortress, etc.; to destroy is to put by any process beyond
restoration physically, mentally, or morally; to destroy an army is so to shatter and scatter it that it can not be
rallied or reassembled as a fighting force. Compare REND.
Antonyms:
attach, bind, fasten, join, mend, secure, solder, unite, weld.
Prepositions:
Break to pieces, or in pieces, into several pieces (when the object is thought of as divided rather than
shattered); break with a friend; from or away from a suppliant; break into a house; out of prison; break across
one's knee; break through a hedge; break in upon one's retirement; break over the rules; break on or upon the
shore, against the rocks.
* * * * *
BRUTISH.
Synonyms:
animal, brutal, ignorant, sensual, swinish, base, brute, imbruted, sottish, unintellectual, beastly, carnal,
insensible, stolid, unspiritual, bestial, coarse, lascivious, stupid, vile.
A brutish man simply follows his animal instincts, without special inclination to do harm; the brutal have
always a spirit of malice and cruelty. Brute has no special character, except as indicating what a brute might
possess; much the same is true of animal, except that animal leans more to the side of sensuality, brute to that
of force, as appears in the familiar phrase "brute force." Hunger is an animal appetite; a brute impulse
suddenly prompts one to strike a blow in anger. Bestial, in modern usage, implies an intensified and degrading
animalism. Any supremacy of the animal or brute instincts over the intellectual and spiritual in man is base
and vile. Beastly refers largely to the outward and visible consequences of excess; as, beastly drunkenness.
Compare ANIMAL.
Antonyms:
elevated, exalted, great, intellectual, noble, enlightened, grand, humane, intelligent, refined.
* * * * *
BURN.
77
Synonyms:
blaze, char, flame, incinerate, set fire to, brand, consume, flash, kindle, set on fire, cauterize, cremate, ignite,
scorch, singe.
To burn is to subject to the action of fire, or of intense heat so as to effect either partial change or complete
combustion; as, to burn wood in the fire; to burn one's hand on a hot stove; the sun burns the face. One
brands with a hot iron, but cauterizes with some corrosive substance, as silver nitrate. Cremate is now used
specifically for consuming a dead body by intense heat. To incinerate is to reduce to ashes; the sense differs
little from that of cremate, but it is in less popular use. To kindle is to set on fire, as if with a candle; ignite is
the more learned and scientific word for the same thing, extending even to the heating of metals to a state of
incandescence without burning. To scorch and to singe are superficial, and to char usually so. Both kindle and
burn have an extensive figurative use; as, to kindle strife; to burn with wrath, love, devotion, curiosity.
Compare LIGHT.
Antonyms:
cool, extinguish, put out, smother, stifle, subdue.
Prepositions:
To burn in the fire, burn with fire; burn to the ground, burn to ashes; burn through the skin, or the roof; burn
into the soil, etc.
* * * * *
BUSINESS.
Synonyms:
affair, commerce, handicraft, trading, art, concern, job, traffic, avocation, craft, occupation, transaction, barter,
duty, profession, vocation, calling, employment, trade, work.
A business is what one follows regularly; an occupation is what he happens at any time to be engaged in;
trout-fishing may be one's occupation for a time, as a relief from business; business is ordinarily for profit,
while the occupation may be a matter of learning, philanthropy, or religion. A profession implies scholarship;
as, the learned professions. Pursuit is an occupation which one follows with ardor. An avocation is what calls
one away from other work; a vocation or calling, that to which one is called by some special fitness or sense
of duty; thus, we speak of the gospel ministry as a vocation or calling, rather than a business. Trade or trading
is, in general, the exchanging of one thing for another; in the special sense, a trade is an occupation involving
manual training and skilled labor; as, the ancient Jews held that every boy should learn a trade. A transaction
is a single action, whether in business, diplomacy, or otherwise; affair has a similar, but lighter meaning; as,
this little affair; an important transaction. The plural affairs has a distinctive meaning, including all activities
where men deal with one another on any considerable scale; as, a man of affairs. A job is a piece of work
viewed as a single undertaking, and ordinarily paid for as such. Trade and commerce may be used as
equivalents, but trade is capable of a more limited application; we speak of the trade of a village, the
commerce of a nation. Barter is the direct exchange of commodities; business, trade, and commerce are
chiefly transacted by means of money, bills of exchange, etc. Business, occupation, etc., may be what one
does independently; employment may be in the service of another. Work is any application of energy to secure
a result, or the result thus secured; thus, we speak of the work of God. Art in the industrial sense is a system of
rules and accepted methods for the accomplishment of some practical result; as, the art of printing;
collectively, the arts. A craft is some occupation requiring technical skill or manual dexterity, or the persons,
78
collectively, engaged in its exercise; as, the weaver's craft.
Prepositions:
The business of a druggist; in business with his father; doing business for his father; have you business with
me? business in New York; business about, concerning, or in regard to certain property.
* * * * *
BUT.
Synonyms:
and, however, notwithstanding, that, barely, just, only, tho, besides, merely, provided, unless, except,
moreover, save, yet. further, nevertheless, still,
But ranges from the faintest contrast to absolute negation; as, I am willing to go, but (on the other hand)
content to stay; he is not an honest man, but (on the contrary) a villain. The contrast may be with a silent
thought; as, but let us go (it being understood that we might stay longer). In restrictive use, except and
excepting are slightly more emphatic than but; we say, no injury but a scratch; or, no injury except some
painful bruises. Such expressions as "words are but breath" (nothing but) may be referred to the restrictive use
by ellipsis. So may the use of but in the sense of unless; as, "it never rains but it pours." To the same head
must be referred the conditional use; as, "you may go, but with your father's consent" (i. e., "provided you
have," "except that you must have," etc.). "Doubt but" is now less used than the more logical "doubt that." But
never becomes a full synonym for and; and adds something like, but adds something different; "brave and
tender" implies that tenderness is natural to the brave; "brave but tender" implies that bravery and tenderness
are rarely combined. For the concessive use, compare NOTWITHSTANDING.
* * * * *
BY.
Synonyms:
by dint of, by means of, through, with.
By refers to the agent; through, to the means, cause, or condition; with, to the instrument. By commonly refers
to persons; with, to things; through may refer to either. The road having become impassable through long
disuse, a way was opened by pioneers with axes. By may, however, be applied to any object which is viewed
as partaking of action and agency; as, the metal was corroded by the acid; skill is gained by practise. We speak
of communicating with a person by letter. Through implies a more distant connection than by or with, and
more intervening elements. Material objects are perceived by the mind through the senses.
* * * * *
CABAL.
Synonyms:
combination, confederacy, crew, gang, conclave, conspiracy, faction, junto.
A conspiracy is a combination of persons for an evil purpose, or the act of so combining. Conspiracy is a
79
distinct crime under common, and generally under statutory, law. A faction is more extensive than a
conspiracy, less formal in organization, less definite in plan. Faction and its adjective, factious, have always
an unfavorable sense. Cabal commonly denotes a conspiracy of leaders. A gang is a company of workmen all
doing the same work under one leader; the word is used figuratively only of combinations which it is meant to
stigmatize as rude and mercenary; crew is used in a closely similar sense. A conclave is secret, but of larger
numbers, ordinarily, than a cabal, and may have honorable use; as, the conclave of cardinals.
* * * * *
CALCULATE.
Synonyms:
account, consider, enumerate, rate, cast, count, estimate, reckon, compute, deem, number, sum up.
Number is the generic term. To count is to number one by one. To calculate is to use more complicated
processes, as multiplication, division, etc., more rapid but not less exact. Compute allows more of the element
of probability, which is still more strongly expressed by estimate. We compute the slain in a great war from
the number known to have fallen in certain great battles; compute refers to the present or the past, estimate
more frequently to the future; as, to estimate the cost of a proposed building. To enumerate is to mention item
by item; as, to enumerate one's grievances. To rate is to estimate by comparison, as if the object were one of a
series. We count upon a desired future; we do not count upon the undesired. As applied to the present, we
reckon or count a thing precious or worthless. Compare ESTEEM.
Prepositions:
It is vain to calculate on or upon an uncertain result.
* * * * *
CALL, v.
Synonyms:
bawl, cry (out), roar, shriek, bellow, ejaculate, scream, vociferate, clamor, exclaim, shout, yell.
To call is to send out the voice in order to attract another's attention, either by word or by inarticulate
utterance. Animals call their mates, or their young; a man calls his dog, his horse, etc. The sense is extended
to include summons by bell, or any signal. To shout is to call or exclaim with the fullest volume of sustained
voice; to scream is to utter a shriller cry; to shriek or to yell refers to that which is louder and wilder still. We
shout words; in screaming, shrieking, or yelling there is often no attempt at articulation. To bawl is to utter
senseless, noisy cries, as of a child in pain or anger. Bellow and roar are applied to the utterances of animals,
and only contemptuously to those of persons. To clamor is to utter with noisy iteration; it applies also to the
confused cries of a multitude. To vociferate is commonly applied to loud and excited speech where there is
little besides the exertion of voice. In exclaiming, the utterance may not be strikingly, tho somewhat, above
the ordinary tone and pitch; we may exclaim by mere interjections, or by connected words, but always by
some articulate utterance. To ejaculate is to throw out brief, disconnected, but coherent utterances of joy,
regret, and especially of appeal, petition, prayer; the use of such devotional utterances has received the special
name of "ejaculatory prayer." To cry out is to give forth a louder and more excited utterance than in
exclaiming or calling; one often exclaims with sudden joy as well as sorrow; if he cries out, it is oftener in
grief or agony. In the most common colloquial usage, to cry is to express grief or pain by weeping or sobbing.
One may exclaim, cry out, or ejaculate with no thought of others' presence; when he calls, it is to attract
80
another's attention.
Antonyms:
be silent, be still, hark, hearken, hush, list, listen.
* * * * *
CALM.
Synonyms:
collected, imperturbable, sedate, still, composed, peaceful, self-possessed, tranquil, cool, placid, serene,
undisturbed, dispassionate, quiet, smooth, unruffled.
That is calm which is free from disturbance or agitation; in the physical sense, free from violent motion or
action; in the mental or spiritual realm, free from excited or disturbing emotion or passion. We speak of a
calm sea, a placid lake, a serene sky, a still night, a quiet day, a quiet home. We speak, also, of "still waters,"
"smooth sailing," which are different modes of expressing freedom from manifest agitation. Of mental
conditions, one is calm who triumphs over a tendency to excitement; cool, if he scarcely feels the tendency.
One may be calm by the very reaction from excitement, or by the oppression of overpowering emotion, as we
speak of the calmness of despair. One is composed who has subdued excited feeling; he is collected when he
has every thought, feeling, or perception awake and at command. Tranquil refers to a present state, placid, to
a prevailing tendency. We speak of a tranquil mind, a placid disposition. The serene spirit dwells as if in the
clear upper air, above all storm and shadow.
The star of the unconquered will, He rises in my breast, Serene, and resolute, and still, And calm, and
self-possessed.
LONGFELLOW Light of Stars st. 7.
Antonyms:

CANCEL.
Synonyms:
abolish, discharge, nullify, rescind, abrogate, efface, obliterate, revoke, annul, erase, quash, rub off or out, blot
out, expunge, remove, scratch out, cross off or out, make void, repeal, vacate.
Cancel, efface, erase, expunge, and obliterate have as their first meaning the removal of written characters or
other forms of record. To cancel is, literally, to make a lattice by cross-lines, exactly our English cross out; to
efface is to rub off, smooth away the face, as of an inscription; to erase is to scratch out, commonly for the
purpose of writing something else in the same space; to expunge, is to punch out with some sharp instrument,
so as to show that the words are no longer part of the writing; to obliterate is to cover over or remove, as a
letter, as was done by reversing the Roman stylus, and rubbing out with the rounded end what had been
written with the point on the waxen tablet. What has been canceled, erased, expunged, may perhaps still be
81
traced; what is obliterated is gone forever, as if it had never been. In many establishments, when a debt is
discharged by payment, the record is canceled. The figurative use of the words keeps close to the primary
sense. Compare ABOLISH.
Antonyms:
approve, enact, establish, perpetuate, reenact, uphold, confirm, enforce, maintain, record, sustain, write.
* * * * *
CANDID.
Synonyms:
aboveboard, honest, open, truthful, artless, impartial, simple, unbiased, fair, ingenuous, sincere, unprejudiced,
frank, innocent, straightforward, unreserved, guileless, naive, transparent, unsophisticated.
A candid statement is meant to be true to the real facts and just to all parties; a fair statement is really so. Fair
is applied to the conduct; candid is not; as, fair treatment, "a fair field, and no favor." One who is frank has a
fearless and unconstrained truthfulness. Honest and ingenuous unite in expressing contempt for deceit. On the
other hand, artless, guileless, naive, simple, and unsophisticated express the goodness which comes from want
of the knowledge or thought of evil. As truth is not always agreeable or timely, candid and frank have often an
objectionable sense; "to be candid with you," "to be perfectly frank," are regarded as sure preludes to
something disagreeable. Open and unreserved may imply unstudied truthfulness or defiant recklessness; as,
open admiration, open robbery. There may be transparent integrity or transparent fraud. Sincere applies to
the feelings, as being all that one's words would imply.
Antonyms:
adroit, cunning, diplomatic, intriguing, sharp, subtle, artful, deceitful, foxy, knowing, shrewd, tricky, crafty,
designing, insincere, maneuvering, sly, wily.
Prepositions:
Candid in debate; candid to or toward opponents; candid with friend or foe; to be candid about or in regard to
the matter.
* * * * *
CAPARISON.
Synonyms:
accouterments, harness, housings, trappings.
Harness was formerly used of the armor of a knight as well as of a horse; it is now used almost exclusively of
the straps and appurtenances worn by a horse when attached to a vehicle; the animal is said to be "kind in
harness." The other words apply to the ornamental outfit of a horse, especially under saddle. We speak also of
the accouterments of a soldier. Caparison is used rarely and somewhat slightingly, and trappings quite
contemptuously, for showy human apparel. Compare ARMS; DRESS.
* * * * *

CAPITAL.
Synonyms:
chief city, metropolis, seat of government.
The metropolis is the chief city in the commercial, the capital in the political sense. The capital of an
American State is rarely its metropolis.
* * * * *
CARE.
Synonyms:
anxiety, concern, oversight, trouble, attention, direction, perplexity, vigilance, caution, forethought,
precaution, wariness, charge, heed, prudence, watchfulness, circumspection, management, solicitude, worry.
Care concerns what we possess; anxiety, often, what we do not; riches bring many cares; poverty brings many
anxieties. Care also signifies watchful attention, in view of possible harm; as, "This side up with care;" "Take
care of yourself;" or, as a sharp warning, "Take care!" Caution has a sense of possible harm and risk only to
be escaped, if at all, by careful deliberation and observation. Care inclines to the positive, caution to the
negative; care is shown in doing, caution largely in not doing. Precaution is allied with care, prudence with
caution; a man rides a dangerous horse with care; caution will keep him from mounting the horse; precaution
looks to the saddle-girths, bit and bridle, and all that may make the rider secure. Circumspection is watchful
observation and calculation, but without the timidity implied in caution. Concern denotes a serious interest,
milder than anxiety; as, concern for the safety of a ship at sea. Heed implies attention without disquiet; it is
now largely displaced by attention and care. Solicitude involves especially the element of desire, not
expressed in anxiety, and of hopefulness, not implied in care. A parent feels constant solicitude for his
children's welfare, anxiety as to dangers that threaten it, with care to guard against them. Watchfulness
recognizes the possibility of danger, wariness the probability. A man who is not influenced by caution to keep
out of danger may display great wariness in the midst of it. Care has also the sense of responsibility, with
possible control, as expressed in charge, management, oversight; as, these children are under my care; send
the money to me in care of the firm. Compare ALARM; ANXIETY; PRUDENCE.
Antonyms:
carelessness, inattention, negligence, oversight, remissness, disregard, indifference, omission, recklessness,
slight. heedlessness, neglect,
Prepositions:
Take care of the house; for the future; about the matter.

A career was originally the ground for a race, or, especially, for a knight's charge in tournament or battle;
whence career was early applied to the charge itself.
If you will use the lance, take ground for your career.... The four horsemen met in full career.
SCOTT Quentin Durward ch. 14, p. 194. [D. F. & CO.]
In its figurative use career signifies some continuous and conspicuous work, usually a life-work, and most
frequently one of honorable achievement. Compare BUSINESS.

CARESS.
Synonyms:
coddle, embrace, fondle, pamper, court, flatter, kiss, pet.
To caress is less than to embrace; more dignified and less familiar than to fondle. A visitor caresses a friend's
child; a mother fondles her babe. Fondling is always by touch; caressing may be also by words, or other
tender and pleasing attentions.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for AFFRONT.
Prepositions:
Caressed by or with the hand; caressed by admirers, at court.
* * * * *
CARICATURE.
Synonyms:
burlesque, extravaganza, mimicry, take-off, exaggeration, imitation, parody, travesty.
A caricature is a grotesque exaggeration of striking features or peculiarities, generally of a person; a
burlesque treats any subject in an absurd or incongruous manner. A burlesque is written or acted; a caricature
is more commonly in sketch or picture. A parody changes the subject, but keeps the style; a travesty keeps the
subject, but changes the style; a burlesque does not hold itself to either subject or style; but is content with a
general resemblance to what it may imitate. A caricature, parody, or travesty must have an original; a
burlesque may be an independent composition. An account of a schoolboys' quarrel after the general manner
of Homer's Iliad would be a burlesque; the real story of the Iliad told in newspaper style would be a travesty.
An extravaganza is a fantastic composition, musical, dramatic, or narrative. Imitation is serious; mimicry is
either intentionally or unintentionally comical.
* * * * *
CARRY.
84
Synonyms:
bear, convey, move, sustain, transmit, bring, lift, remove, take, transport.
A person may bear a load either when in motion or at rest; he carries it only when in motion. The stooping
Atlas bears the world on his shoulders; swiftly moving Time carries the hour-glass and scythe; a person may
be said either to bear or to carry a scar, since it is upon him whether in motion or at rest. If an object is to be
moved from the place we occupy, we say carry; if to the place we occupy, we say bring. A messenger carries
a letter to a correspondent, and brings an answer. Take is often used in this sense in place of carry; as, take
that letter to the office. Carry often signifies to transport by personal strength, without reference to the
direction; as, that is more than he can carry; yet, even so, it would not be admissible to say carry it to me, or
carry it here; in such case we must say bring. To lift is simply to raise from the ground, tho but for an instant,
with no reference to holding or moving; one may be able to lift what he could not carry. The figurative uses of
carry are very numerous; as, to carry an election, carry the country, carry (in the sense of capture) a fort,
carry an audience, carry a stock of goods, etc. Compare CONVEY; KEEP; SUPPORT.
Antonyms:
drop, fall under, give up, let go, shake off, throw down, throw off.
Prepositions:
To carry coals to Newcastle; carry nothing from, or out of, this house; he carried these qualities into all he did;
carry across the street, over the bridge, through the woods, around or round the corner; beyond the river; the
cable was carried under the sea.
* * * * *
CATASTROPHE.
Synonyms:
calamity, denouement, mischance, mishap, cataclysm, disaster, misfortune, sequel.
A cataclysm or catastrophe is some great convulsion or momentous event that may or may not be a cause of
misery to man. In calamity, or disaster, the thought of human suffering is always present. It has been held by
many geologists that numerous catastrophes or cataclysms antedated the existence of man. In literature, the
final event of a drama is the catastrophe, or denouement. Misfortune ordinarily suggests less of suddenness
and violence than calamity or disaster, and is especially applied to that which is lingering or enduring in its
effects. In history, the end of every great war or the fall of a nation is a catastrophe, tho it may not be a
calamity. Yet such an event, if not a calamity to the race, will always involve much individual disaster and
misfortune. Pestilence is a calamity; a defeat in battle, a shipwreck, or a failure in business is a disaster;
sickness or loss of property is a misfortune; failure to meet a friend is a mischance; the breaking of a teacup is
a mishap.
Antonyms:
benefit, boon, favor, pleasure, prosperity, blessing, comfort, help, privilege, success.
Preposition:
The catastrophe of a play; of a siege; rarely, to a person, etc.

CATCH.
Synonyms:
apprehend, comprehend, grasp, overtake, snatch, capture, discover, grip, secure, take, clasp, ensnare, gripe,
seize, take hold of. clutch, entrap, lay hold of (on, upon),
To catch is to come up with or take possession of something departing, fugitive, or illusive. We catch a
runaway horse, a flying ball, a mouse in a trap. We clutch with a swift, tenacious movement of the fingers; we
grasp with a firm but moderate closure of the whole hand; we grip or gripe with the strongest muscular
closure of the whole hand possible to exert. We clasp in the arms. We snatch with a quick, sudden, and
usually a surprising motion. In the figurative sense, catch is used of any act that brings a person or thing into
our power or possession; as, to catch a criminal in the act; to catch an idea, in the sense of apprehend or
comprehend. Compare ARREST.
Antonyms:
fail of, give up, lose, release, throw aside, fall short of, let go, miss, restore, throw away.
Prepositions:
To catch at a straw; to catch a fugitive by the collar; to catch a ball with the left hand; he caught the disease
from the patient; the thief was caught in the act; the bird in the snare.
* * * * *
CAUSE.
Synonyms:
actor, causality, designer, occasion, precedent, agent, causation, former, origin, reason, antecedent, condition,
fountain, originator, source, author, creator, motive, power, spring.
The efficient cause, that which makes anything to be or be done, is the common meaning of the word, as in
the saying "There is no effect without a cause." Every man instinctively recognizes himself acting through
will as the cause of his own actions. The Creator is the Great First Cause of all things. A condition is
something that necessarily precedes a result, but does not produce it. An antecedent simply precedes a result,
with or without any agency in producing it; as, Monday is the invariable antecedent of Tuesday, but not the
cause of it. The direct antonym of cause is effect, while that of antecedent is consequent. An occasion is some
event which brings a cause into action at a particular moment; gravitation and heat are the causes of an
avalanche; the steep incline of the mountain-side is a necessary condition, and the shout of the traveler may be
the occasion of its fall. Causality is the doctrine or principle of causes, causation the action or working of
causes. Compare DESIGN; REASON.
Antonyms:
consequence, development, end, fruit, outcome, product, creation, effect, event, issue, outgrowth, result.
Prepositions:
86
The cause of the disaster; cause for interference.
* * * * *
CEASE.
Synonyms:
abstain, desist, give over, quit, bring to an end, discontinue, intermit, refrain, come to an end, end, leave off,
stop, conclude, finish, pause, terminate.
Strains of music may gradually or suddenly cease. A man quits work on the instant; he may discontinue a
practise gradually; he quits suddenly and completely; he stops short in what he may or may not resume; he
pauses in what he will probably resume. What intermits or is intermitted returns again, as a fever that
intermits. Compare ABANDON; DIE; END; REST.
Antonyms:
begin, inaugurate, originate, set going, set on foot, commence, initiate, set about, set in operation, start. enter
upon, institute,
Preposition:
Cease from anger.
* * * * *
CELEBRATE.
Synonyms:
commemorate, keep, observe, solemnize.
To celebrate any event or occasion is to make some demonstration of respect or rejoicing because of or in
memory of it, or to perform such public rites or ceremonies as it properly demands. We celebrate the birth,
commemorate the death of one beloved or honored. We celebrate a national anniversary with music and song,
with firing of guns and ringing of bells; we commemorate by any solemn and thoughtful service, or by a
monument or other enduring memorial. We keep the Sabbath, solemnize a marriage, observe an anniversary;
we celebrate or observe the Lord's Supper in which believers commemorate the sufferings and death of Christ.
Antonyms:
contemn, dishonor, forget, neglect, profane, despise, disregard, ignore, overlook, violate.
Prepositions:
We celebrate the day with appropriate ceremonies; the victory was celebrated by the people, with rejoicing.
* * * * *
CENTER.
87
Synonyms:
middle, midst.
We speak of the center of a circle, the middle of a room, the middle of the street, the midst of a forest. The
center is equally distant from every point of the circumference of a circle, or from the opposite boundaries on
each axis of a parallelogram, etc.; the middle is more general and less definite. The center is a point; the
middle may be a line or a space. We say at the center; in the middle. Midst commonly implies a group or
multitude of surrounding objects. Compare synonyms for AMID.
Antonyms:
bound, boundary, circumference, perimeter, rim.
* * * * *
CHAGRIN.
Synonyms:
confusion, discomposure, humiliation, shame, disappointment, dismay, mortification, vexation.
Chagrin unites disappointment with some degree of humiliation. A rainy day may bring disappointment;
needless failure in some enterprise brings chagrin. Shame involves the consciousness of fault, guilt, or
impropriety; chagrin of failure of judgment, or harm to reputation. A consciousness that one has displayed his
own ignorance will cause him mortification, however worthy his intent; if there was a design to deceive, the
exposure will cover him with shame.
Antonyms:
delight, exultation, glory, rejoicing, triumph.
Prepositions:
He felt deep chagrin at (because of, on account of) failure.
* * * * *
CHANGE, v.
Synonyms:
alter, exchange, shift, transmute, commute, metamorphose, substitute, turn, convert, modify, transfigure, vary,
diversify, qualify, transform, veer.
To change is distinctively to make a thing other than it has been, in some respect at least; to exchange to put
or take something else in its place; to alter is ordinarily to change partially, to make different in one or more
particulars. To exchange is often to transfer ownership; as, to exchange city for country property. Change is
often used in the sense of exchange; as, to change horses. To transmute is to change the qualities while the
substance remains the same; as, to transmute the baser metals into gold. To transform is to change form or
appearance, with or without deeper and more essential change; it is less absolute than transmute, tho
sometimes used for that word, and is often used in a spiritual sense as transmute could not be; "Be ye
88
transformed by the renewing of your mind," Rom. xii, 2. Transfigure is, as in its Scriptural use, to change in
an exalted and glorious spiritual way; "Jesus ... was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the
sun, and his raiment was white as the light," Matt. xvii, 1, 2. To metamorphose is to make some remarkable
change, ordinarily in external qualities, but often in structure, use, or chemical constitution, as of a caterpillar
into a butterfly, of the stamens of a plant into petals, or of the crystalline structure of rocks, hence called
"metamorphic rocks," as when a limestone is metamorphosed into a marble. To vary is to change from time to
time, often capriciously. To commute is to put something easier, lighter, milder, or in some way more
favorable in place of that which is commuted; as, to commute capital punishment to imprisonment for life; to
commute daily fares on a railway to a monthly payment. To convert (L. con, with, and verto, turn) is to
primarily turn about, and signifies to change in form, character, use, etc., through a wide range of relations;
iron is converted into steel, joy into grief, a sinner into a saint. To turn is a popular word for change in any
sense short of the meaning of exchange, being often equivalent to alter, convert, transform, transmute, etc.
We modify or qualify a statement which might seem too strong; we modify it by some limitation, qualify it by
some addition.
Antonyms:
abide, continue, hold, persist, retain, bide, endure, keep, remain, stay.
Prepositions:
To change a home toilet for a street dress; to change from a caterpillar to or into a butterfly; to change clothes
with a beggar.
* * * * *
CHANGE, n.
Synonyms:
alteration, mutation, renewing, transmutation, conversion, novelty, revolution, variation, diversity,
regeneration, transformation, variety, innovation, renewal, transition, vicissitude.
A change is a passing from one state or form to another, any act or process by which a thing becomes unlike
what it was before, or the unlikeness so produced; we say a change was taking place, or the change that had
taken place was manifest. Mutation is a more formal word for change, often suggesting repeated or continual
change; as, the mutations of fortune. Novelty is a change to what is new, or the newness of that to which a
change is made; as, he was perpetually desirous of novelty. Revolution is specifically and most commonly a
change of government. Variation is a partial change in form, qualities, etc., but especially in position or
action; as, the variation of the magnetic needle or of the pulse. Variety is a succession of changes or an
intermixture of different things, and is always thought of as agreeable. Vicissitude is sharp, sudden, or violent
change, always thought of as surprising and often as disturbing or distressing; as, the vicissitudes of politics.
Transition is change by passing from one place or state to another, especially in a natural, regular, or orderly
way; as, the transition from spring to summer, or from youth to manhood. An innovation is a change that
breaks in upon an established order or custom; as, an innovation in religion or politics. For the distinctions
between the other words compare the synonyms for CHANGE, v. In the religious sense regeneration is the
vital renewing of the soul by the power of the divine Spirit; conversion is the conscious and manifest change
from evil to good, or from a lower to a higher spiritual state; as, in Luke xxii, 32, "when thou art converted,
strengthen thy brethren." In popular use conversion is the most common word to express the idea of
regeneration.
Antonyms:
89
constancy, fixedness, invariability, steadiness, continuance, fixity, permanence, unchangeableness, firmness,
identity, persistence, uniformity.
Prepositions:
We have made a change for the better; the change from winter to spring; the change of a liquid to or into a
gas; a change in quality; a change by absorption or oxidation.
* * * * *
CHARACTER.
Synonyms:
constitution, genius, personality, reputation, temper, disposition, nature, record, spirit, temperament.
Character is what one is; reputation, what he is thought to be; his record is the total of his known action or
inaction. As a rule, a man's record will substantially express his character; his reputation may be higher or
lower than his character or record will justify. Repute is a somewhat formal word, with the same general
sense as reputation. One's nature includes all his original endowments or propensities; character includes
both natural and acquired traits. We speak of one's physical constitution as strong or weak, etc., and
figuratively, always with the adjective, of his mental or moral constitution. Compare CHARACTERISTIC.
Prepositions:
The witness has a character for veracity; his character is above suspicion; the character of the applicant.
* * * * *
CHARACTERISTIC.
Synonyms:
attribute, feature, peculiarity, sign, trace, character, indication, property, singularity, trait. distinction, mark,
quality,
A characteristic belongs to the nature or character of the person, thing, or class, and serves to identify an
object; as, a copper-colored skin, high cheek-bones, and straight, black hair are characteristics of the
American Indian. A sign is manifest to an observer; a mark or a characteristic may be more difficult to
discover; an insensible person may show signs of life, while sometimes only close examination will disclose
marks of violence. Pallor is ordinarily a mark of fear; but in some brave natures it is simply a characteristic of
intense earnestness. Mark is sometimes used in a good, but often in a bad sense; we speak of the
characteristic of a gentleman, the mark of a villain. Compare ATTRIBUTE; CHARACTER.
* * * * *
CHARMING.
Synonyms:
bewitching, delightful, enrapturing, fascinating, captivating, enchanting, entrancing, winning.
90
That is charming or bewitching which is adapted to win others as by a magic spell. Enchanting, enrapturing,
entrancing represent the influence as not only supernatural, but irresistible and delightful. That which is
fascinating may win without delighting, drawing by some unseen power, as a serpent its prey; we can speak of
horrible fascination. Charming applies only to what is external to oneself; delightful may apply to personal
experiences or emotions as well; we speak of a charming manner, a charming dress, but of delightful
anticipations. Compare AMIABLE; BEAUTIFUL.
* * * * *
CHASTEN.
Synonyms:
afflict, chastise, discipline, punish, refine, subdue, castigate, correct, humble, purify, soften, try.
Castigate and chastise refer strictly to corporal punishment, tho both are somewhat archaic; correct and
punish are often used as euphemisms in preference to either. Punish is distinctly retributive in sense; chastise,
partly retributive, and partly corrective; chasten, wholly corrective. Chasten is used exclusively in the spiritual
sense, and chiefly of the visitation of God.
Prepositions:
"We are chastened of the Lord," 1 Cor. xi, 32; "they ... chastened us after their own pleasure, but He for our
profit," Heb. xii, 10; "chasten in thy hot displeasure," Ps. iv, 7; chasten with pain; by trials and sorrows.
* * * * *
CHERISH.
Synonyms:
cheer, encourage, harbor, nurse, shelter, cling to, entertain, hold dear, nurture, treasure, comfort, foster,
nourish, protect, value.
To cherish is both to hold dear and to treat as dear. Mere unexpressed esteem would not be cherishing. In the
marriage vow, "to love, honor, and cherish," the word cherish implies all that each can do by love and
tenderness for the welfare and happiness of the other, as by support, protection, care in sickness, comfort in
sorrow, sympathy, and help of every kind. To nurse is to tend the helpless or feeble, as infants, or the sick or
wounded. To nourish is strictly to sustain and build up by food; to nurture includes careful mental and
spiritual training, with something of love and tenderness; to foster is simply to maintain and care for, to bring
up; a foster-child will be nourished, but may not be as tenderly nurtured or as lovingly cherished as if one's
own. In the figurative sense, the opinion one cherishes he holds, not with mere cold conviction, but with
loving devotion.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ABANDON; CHASTEN.
* * * * *
CHOOSE.
91
Synonyms:
cull, elect, pick, pick out, prefer, select.
Prefer indicates a state of desire and approval; choose, an act of will. Prudence or generosity may lead one to
choose what he does not prefer. Select implies a careful consideration of the reasons for preference and
choice. Among objects so nearly alike that we have no reason to prefer any one to another we may simply
choose the nearest, but we could not be said to select it. Aside from theology, elect is popularly confined to
the political sense; as, a free people elect their own rulers. Cull, from the Latin colligere, commonly means to
collect, as well as to select. In a garden we cull the choicest flowers.
Antonyms:
cast away, decline, dismiss, refuse, repudiate, cast out, disclaim, leave, reject, throw aside.
Prepositions:
Choose from or from among the number; choose out of the army; choose between (or betwixt) two; among
many; choose for the purpose.
* * * * *
CIRCUMLOCUTION.
Synonyms:
diffuseness, prolixity, surplusage, verbiage, periphrasis, redundance, tautology, verbosity, pleonasm,
redundancy, tediousness, wordiness.
Circumlocution and periphrasis are roundabout ways of expressing thought; circumlocution is the more
common, periphrasis the more technical word. Constant circumlocution produces an affected and heavy style;
occasionally, skilful periphrasis conduces both to beauty and to simplicity. Etymologically, diffuseness is a
scattering, both of words and thought; redundancy is an overflow. Prolixity goes into endless petty details,
without selection or perspective. Pleonasm is the expression of an idea already plainly implied; tautology is
the restatement in other words of an idea already stated, or a useless repetition of a word or words. Pleonasm
may add emphasis; tautology is always a fault. "I saw it with my eyes" is a pleonasm; "all the members agreed
unanimously" is tautology. Verbiage is the use of mere words without thought. Verbosity and wordiness
denote an excess of words in proportion to the thought. Tediousness is the sure result of any of these faults of
style.
Antonyms:
brevity, compression, condensation, plainness, succinctness, compactness, conciseness, directness, shortness,
terseness.
* * * * *
CIRCUMSTANCE.
Synonyms:
accompaniment, fact, item, point, concomitant, feature, occurrence, position, detail, incident, particular,
92
situation. event,
A circumstance (L. circum, around, and sto, stand), is something existing or occurring in connection with or
relation to some other fact or event, modifying or throwing light upon the principal matter without affecting
its essential character; an accompaniment is something that unites with the principal matter, tho not necessary
to it; as, the piano accompaniment to a song; a concomitant goes with a thing in natural connection, but in a
subordinate capacity, or perhaps in contrast; as, cheerfulness is a concomitant of virtue. A circumstance is not
strictly, nor usually, an occasion, condition, effect, or result. (See these words under CAUSE.) Nor is the
circumstance properly an incident. (See under ACCIDENT.) We say, "My decision will depend upon
circumstances"--not "upon incidents." That a man wore a blue necktie would not probably be the cause,
occasion, condition, or concomitant of his committing murder; but it might be a very important circumstance
in identifying him as the murderer. All the circumstances make up the situation. A certain disease is the cause
of a man's death; his suffering is an incident; that he is in his own home, that he has good medical attendance,
careful nursing, etc., are consolatory circumstances. With the same idea of subordination, we often say, "This
is not a circumstance to that." So a person is said to be in easy circumstances. Compare EVENT.
Prepositions:
"Mere situation is expressed by 'in the circumstances'; action affected is performed 'under the circumstances.'"
[M.]
* * * * *
CLASS.
Synonyms:
association, circle, clique, company, grade, rank, caste, clan, club, coterie, order, set.
A class is a number or body of persons or objects having common pursuits, purposes, attributes, or
characteristics. A caste is hereditary; a class may be independent of lineage or descent; membership in a caste
is supposed to be for life; membership in a class may be very transient; a religious and ceremonial sacredness
attaches to the caste, as not to the class. The rich and the poor form separate classes; yet individuals are
constantly passing from each to the other; the classes in a college remain the same, but their membership
changes every year. We speak of rank among hereditary nobility or military officers; of various orders of the
priesthood; by accommodation, we may refer in a general way to the higher ranks, the lower orders of any
society. Grade implies some regular scale of valuation, and some inherent qualities for which a person or
thing is placed higher or lower in the scale; as, the coarser and finer grades of wool; a man of an inferior
grade. A coterie is a small company of persons of similar tastes, who meet frequently in an informal way,
rather for social enjoyment than for any serious purpose. Clique has always an unfavorable meaning. A clique
is always fractional, implying some greater gathering of which it is a part; the association breaks up into
cliques. Persons unite in a coterie through simple liking for one another; they withdraw into a clique largely
through aversion to outsiders. A set, while exclusive, is more extensive than a clique, and chiefly of persons
who are united by common social station, etc. Circle is similar in meaning to set, but of wider application; we
speak of scientific and religious as well as of social circles.
Prepositions:
A class of merchants; the senior class at (sometimes of) Harvard; the classes in college.
* * * * *
93
CLEANSE.
Synonyms:
brush, dust, purify, scour, sponge, wash, clean, lave, rinse, scrub, sweep, wipe. disinfect, mop,
To clean is to make clean by removing dirt, impurities, or soil of any kind. Cleanse implies a worse condition
to start from, and more to do, than clean. Hercules cleansed the Augean stables. Cleanse is especially applied
to purifying processes where liquid is used, as in the flushing of a street, etc. We brush clothing if dusty,
sponge it, or sponge it off, if soiled; or sponge off a spot. Furniture, books, etc., are dusted; floors are mopped
or scrubbed; metallic utensils are scoured; a room is swept; soiled garments are washed; foul air or water is
purified. Cleanse and purify are used extensively in a moral sense; wash in that sense is archaic. Compare
AMEND.
Antonyms:
befoul, bespatter, debase, deprave, soil, stain, taint, besmear, contaminate, defile, pollute, spoil, sully, vitiate.
besmirch, corrupt,
Prepositions:
Cleanse of or from physical or moral defilement; cleanse with an instrument; by an agent; the room was
cleansed by the attendants with soap and water.
* * * * *
CLEAR.
Synonyms:
apparent, intelligible, pellucid, transparent, diaphanous, limpid, perspicuous, unadorned, distinct, lucid, plain,
unambiguous, evident, manifest, straightforward, unequivocal, explicit, obvious, translucent, unmistakable.
Clear (L. clarus, bright, brilliant) primarily refers to that which shines, and impresses the mind through the
eye with a sense of luster or splendor. A substance is said to be clear that offers no impediment to vision--is
not dim, dark, or obscure. Transparent refers to the medium through which a substance is seen, clear to the
substance itself, without reference to anything to be seen through it; we speak of a stream as clear when we
think of the water itself; we speak of it as transparent with reference to the ease with which we see the
pebbles at the bottom. Clear is also said of that which comes to the senses without dimness, dulness,
obstruction, or obscurity, so that there is no uncertainty as to its exact form, character, or meaning, with
something of the brightness or brilliancy implied in the primary meaning of the word clear; as, the outlines of
the ship were clear against the sky; a clear view; a clear note; "clear as a bell;" a clear, frosty air; a clear sky;
a clear statement; hence, the word is used for that which is free from any kind of obstruction; as, a clear field.
Lucid and pellucid refer to a shining clearness, as of crystal. A transparent body allows the forms and colors
of objects beyond to be seen through it; a translucent body allows light to pass through, but may not permit
forms and colors to be distinguished; plate glass is transparent, ground glass is translucent. Limpid refers to a
liquid clearness, or that which suggests it; as, limpid streams. That which is distinct is well defined, especially
in outline, each part or object standing or seeming apart from any other, not confused, indefinite, or blurred;
distinct enunciation enables the hearer to catch every word or vocal sound without perplexity or confusion; a
distinct statement is free from indefiniteness or ambiguity; a distinct apprehension of a thought leaves the
mind in no doubt or uncertainty regarding it. That is plain, in the sense here considered, which is, as it were,
level to the thought, so that one goes straight on without difficulty or hindrance; as, plain language; a plain
94
statement; a clear explanation. Perspicuous is often equivalent to plain, but plain never wholly loses the
meaning of unadorned, so that we can say the style is perspicuous tho highly ornate, when we could not call it
at once ornate and plain. Compare EVIDENT.
Antonyms:
ambiguous, dim, foggy, mysterious, opaque, unintelligible, cloudy, dubious, indistinct, obscure, turbid, vague.
Prepositions:
Clear to the mind; clear in argument; clear of or from annoyances.
* * * * *
CLEVER.
Synonyms:
able, capable, happy, keen, sharp, adroit, dexterous, ingenious, knowing, skilful, apt, expert, intellectual,
quick, smart, bright, gifted, intelligent, quick-witted, talented.
Clever, as used in England, especially implies an aptitude for study or learning, and for excellent tho not
preeminent mental achievement. The early New England usage as implying simple and weak good nature has
largely affected the use of the word throughout the United States, where it has never been much in favor.
Smart, indicating dashing ability, is now coming to have a suggestion of unscrupulousness, similar to that of
the word sharp, which makes its use a doubtful compliment. The discriminating use of such words as able,
gifted, talented, etc., is greatly preferable to an excessive use of the word clever. Compare ACUMEN;
ASTUTE; POWER.
Antonyms:
awkward, clumsy, foolish, ignorant, slow, thick-headed, bungling, dull, idiotic, senseless, stupid, witless.
* * * * *
COLLISION.
Synonyms:
clash, concussion, contact, impact, opposition, clashing, conflict, encounter, meeting, shock.
Collision, the act or fact of striking violently together, is the result of motion or action, and is sudden and
momentary; contact may be a condition of rest, and be continuous and permanent; collision is sudden and
violent contact. Concussion is often by transmitted force rather than by direct impact; two railway-trains come
into collision; an explosion of dynamite shatters neighboring windows by concussion. Impact is the blow
given by the striking body; as, the impact of the cannon-shot upon the target. An encounter is always violent,
and generally hostile. Meeting is neutral, and may be of the dearest friends or of the bitterest foes; of objects,
of persons, or of opinions; of two or of a multitude. Shock is the result of collision. In the figurative use, we
speak of clashing of views, collision of persons. Opposition is used chiefly of persons, more rarely of
opinions or interests; conflict is used indifferently of all.
Antonyms:
95
agreement, coincidence, concord, conformity, unison, amity, concert, concurrence, harmony, unity.
Prepositions:
Collision of one object with another; of or between opposing objects.
* * * * *
COMFORTABLE.
Synonyms:
agreeable, cheery, genial, snug, at ease, commodious, pleasant, well-off, at rest, contented, satisfactory,
well-provided, cheerful, convenient, satisfied, well-to-do.
A person is comfortable in mind when contented and measurably satisfied. A little additional brightness
makes him cheerful. He is comfortable in body when free from pain, quiet, at ease, at rest. He is comfortable
in circumstances, or in comfortable circumstances, when things about him are generally agreeable and
satisfactory, usually with the suggestion of sufficient means to secure that result.
Antonyms:
cheerless, discontented, distressed, forlorn, uncomfortable, disagreeable, dissatisfied, dreary, miserable,
wretched.
* * * * *
COMMIT.
Synonyms:
assign, confide, consign, entrust, relegate, trust.
Commit, in the sense here considered, is to give in charge, put into care or keeping; to confide or entrust is to
commit especially to one's fidelity, confide being used chiefly of mental or spiritual, entrust also of material
things; we assign a duty, confide a secret, entrust a treasure; we commit thoughts to writing; commit a paper to
the flames, a body to the earth; a prisoner is committed to jail. Consign is a formal word in mercantile use; as,
to consign goods to an agent. Religiously, we consign the body to the grave, commit the soul to God. Compare
DO.
Prepositions:
Commit to a friend for safe-keeping; in law, commit to prison; for trial; without bail; in default of bail; on
suspicion.

COMPANY.
Synonyms:
assemblage, concourse, convocation, host, assembly, conference, crowd, meeting, collection, congregation,
96
gathering, multitude, conclave, convention, group, throng.
Company, from the Latin cum, with, and panis, bread, denotes primarily the association of those who eat at a
common table, or the persons so associated, table-companions, messmates, friends, and hence is widely
extended to include any association of those united permanently or temporarily, for business, pleasure,
festivity, travel, etc., or by sorrow, misfortune, or wrong; company may denote an indefinite number
(ordinarily more than two), but less than a multitude; in the military sense a company is a limited and definite
number of men; company implies more unity of feeling and purpose than crowd, and is a less formal and more
familiar word than assemblage or assembly. An assemblage may be of persons or of objects; an assembly is
always of persons. An assemblage is promiscuous and unorganized; an assembly is organized and united in
some common purpose. A conclave is a secret assembly. A convocation is an assembly called by authority for
a special purpose; the term convention suggests less dependence upon any superior authority or summons. A
group is small in number and distinct in outline, clearly marked off from all else in space or time. Collection,
crowd, gathering, group, and multitude have the unorganized and promiscuous character of the assemblage;
the other terms come under the general idea of assembly. Congregation is now almost exclusively religious;
meeting is often so used, but is less restricted, as we may speak of a meeting of armed men. Gathering refers
to a coming together, commonly of numbers, from far and near; as, the gathering of the Scottish clans.
Antonyms:
dispersion, loneliness, privacy, retirement, seclusion, solitude.
* * * * *
COMPEL.
Synonyms:
coerce, drive, make, oblige. constrain, force, necessitate,
To compel one to an act is to secure its performance by the use of irresistible physical or moral force. Force
implies primarily an actual physical process, absolutely subduing all resistance. Coerce implies the actual or
potential use of so much force as may be necessary to secure the surrender of the will; the American
secessionists contended that the Federal government had no right to coerce a State. Constrain implies the
yielding of judgment and will, and in some cases of inclination or affection, to an overmastering power; as,
"the love of Christ constraineth us," 2 Cor. v, 14. Compare DRIVE; INFLUENCE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for HINDER.
Prepositions:
The soldiers were compelled to desertion: preferably with the infinitive, compelled to desert.
* * * * *
COMPLAIN.
Synonyms:
croak, growl, grunt, remonstrate, find fault, grumble, murmur, repine.
97
To complain is to give utterance to dissatisfaction or objection, express a sense of wrong or ill treatment. One
complains of a real or assumed grievance; he may murmur through mere peevishness or ill temper; he repines,
with vain distress, at the irrevocable or the inevitable. Complaining is by speech or writing; murmuring is
commonly said of half-repressed utterance; repining of the mental act alone. One may complain of an offense
to the offender or to others; he remonstrates with the offender only. Complain has a formal and legal meaning,
which the other words have not, signifying to make a formal accusation, present a specific charge; the same is
true of the noun complaint.
Antonyms:
applaud, approve, commend, eulogize, laud, praise.
Prepositions:
Complain of a thing to a person; of one person to another, of or against a person for an act; to an officer;
before the court; about a thing.
* * * * *
COMPLEX.
Synonyms:
abstruse, confused, intricate, mixed, complicated, conglomerate, involved, multiform, composite, entangled,
manifold, obscure, compound, heterogeneous, mingled, tangled.
That is complex which is made up of several connected parts. That is compound in which the parts are not
merely connected, but fused, or otherwise combined into a single substance. In a composite object the
different parts have less of unity than in that which is complex or compound, but maintain their distinct
individuality. In a heterogeneous body unlike parts or particles are intermingled, often without apparent order
or plan. Conglomerate (literally, globed together) is said of a confused mingling of masses or lumps of various
substances. The New England pudding-stone is a conglomerate rock. In a complex object the arrangement and
relation of parts may be perfectly clear; in a complicated mechanism the parts are so numerous, or so
combined, that the mind can not readily grasp their mutual relations; in an intricate arrangement the parts are
so intertwined that it is difficult to follow their windings; things are involved which are rolled together so as
not to be easily separated, either in thought or in fact; things which are tangled or entangled mutually hold
and draw upon each other. The conception of a material object is usually complex, involving form, color, size,
and other elements; a clock is a complicated mechanism; the Gordian knot was intricate; the twining serpents
of the Laocoon are involved. We speak of an abstruse statement, a complex conception, a confused heap, a
heterogeneous mass, a tangled skein, an intricate problem; of composite architecture, an involved sentence; of
the complicated or intricate accounts of a great business, the entangled accounts of an incompetent or
dishonest bookkeeper.
Antonyms:
clear, homogeneous, plain, uncombined, uniform, direct, obvious, simple, uncompounded, unraveled.
* * * * *
CONDEMN.
Synonyms:
98
blame, convict, doom, reprove, censure, denounce, reprobate, sentence.
To condemn is to pass judicial sentence or render judgment or decision against. We may censure silently; we
condemn ordinarily by open and formal utterance. Condemn is more final than blame or censure; a
condemned criminal has had his trial; a condemned building can not stand; a condemned ship can not sail. A
person is convicted when his guilt is made clearly manifest to others; in somewhat archaic use, a person is said
to be convicted when guilt is brought clearly home to his own conscience (convict in this sense being allied
with convince, which see under PERSUADE); in legal usage one is said to be convicted only by the verdict of
a jury. In stating the penalty of an offense, the legal word sentence is now more common than condemn; as, he
was sentenced to imprisonment; but it is good usage to say, he was condemned to imprisonment. To denounce
is to make public or official declaration against, especially in a violent and threatening manner.
From the pulpits in the northern States Burr was denounced as an assassin.
COFFIN Building the Nation ch. 10, p. 137. [H. '83.]
To doom is to condemn solemnly and consign to evil or destruction or to predetermine to an evil destiny; an
inferior race in presence of a superior is doomed to subjugation or extinction. Compare ARRAIGN;
REPROVE.
Antonyms:
absolve, applaud, exonerate, pardon, acquit, approve, justify, praise.
Prepositions:
The bandit was condemned to death for his crime.
* * * * *
CONFESS.
Synonyms:
accept, allow, concede, grant, acknowledge, avow, disclose, own, admit, certify, endorse, recognize.
We accept another's statement; admit any point made against us; acknowledge what we have said or done,
good or bad; avow our individual beliefs or feelings; certify to facts within our knowledge; confess our own
faults; endorse a friend's note or statement; grant a request; own our faults or obligations; recognize lawful
authority; concede a claim. Confess has a high and sacred use in the religious sense; as, to confess Christ
before men. It may have also a playful sense (often with to); as, one confesses to a weakness for
confectionery. The chief present use of the word, however, is in the sense of making known to others one's
own wrong-doing; in this sense confess is stronger than acknowledge or admit, and more specific than own; a
person admits a mistake; acknowledges a fault; confesses sin or crime. Compare APOLOGY; AVOW.
Antonyms:
cloak, deny, disown, hide, screen, conceal, disavow, dissemble, mask, secrete, cover, disguise, dissimulate,
repudiate, veil.
* * * * *
99
CONFIRM.
Synonyms:
assure, fix, sanction, substantiate, corroborate, prove, settle, sustain, establish, ratify, strengthen, uphold.
Confirm (L. con, together, and firmus, firm) is to add firmness or give stability to. Both confirm and
corroborate presuppose something already existing to which the confirmation or corroboration is added.
Testimony is corroborated by concurrent testimony or by circumstances; confirmed by established facts. That
which is thoroughly proved is said to be established; so is that which is official and has adequate power
behind it; as, the established government; the established church. The continents are fixed. A treaty is ratified;
an appointment confirmed. An act is sanctioned by any person or authority that passes upon it approvingly. A
statement is substantiated; a report confirmed; a controversy settled; the decision of a lower court sustained
by a higher. Just government should be upheld. The beneficent results of Christianity confirm our faith in it as
a divine revelation.
Antonyms:
abrogate, cancel, overthrow, shatter, upset, annul, destroy, shake, unsettle, weaken.
Prepositions:
Confirm a statement by testimony; confirm a person in a belief.
* * * * *
CONGRATULATE.
Synonym:
felicitate.
To felicitate is to pronounce one happy or wish one joy; to congratulate is to express hearty sympathy in his
joys or hopes. Felicitate is cold and formal. We say one felicitates himself; tho to congratulate oneself, which
is less natural, is becoming prevalent.
Antonyms:
condole with, console.
Prepositions:
Congratulate one on or upon his success.
* * * * *
CONQUER.
Synonyms:
beat, humble, overthrow, subject, checkmate, master, prevail over, subjugate, crush, overcome, put down,
surmount, defeat, overmaster, reduce, vanquish, discomfit, overmatch, rout, win, down, overpower, subdue,
worst.
To defeat an enemy is to gain an advantage for the time; to vanquish is to win a signal victory; to conquer is
to overcome so effectually that the victory is regarded as final. Conquer, in many cases, carries the idea of
possession; as, to conquer respect, affection, peace, etc. A country is conquered when its armies are defeated
and its territory is occupied by the enemy; it may be subjected to indemnity or to various disabilities; it is
subjugated when it is held helplessly and continuously under military control; it is subdued when all
resistance has died out. An army is defeated when forcibly driven back; it is routed when it is converted into a
mob of fugitives. Compare BEAT.
Antonyms:
capitulate, fail, fly, lose, retire, submit, surrender, cede, fall, forfeit, resign, retreat, succumb, yield.
* * * * *
CONSCIOUS.
Synonyms:
advised, assured, certain, cognizant, sensible, apprised, aware, certified, informed, sure.
One is aware of that which exists without him; he is conscious of the inner workings of his own mind.
Sensible may be used in the exact sense of conscious, or it may partake of both the senses mentioned above.
One may be sensible of his own or another's error; he is conscious only of his own. A person may feel assured
or sure of something false or non-existent; what he is aware of, still more what he is conscious of, must be
fact. Sensible has often a reference to the emotions where conscious might apply only to the intellect; to say a
culprit is sensible of his degradation is more forcible than to say he is conscious of it.
Antonyms:
cold, dead, deaf, ignorant, insensible, unaware, unconscious.
Preposition:
On the stormy sea, man is conscious of the limitation of human power.
* * * * *
CONSEQUENCE.
Synonyms:
consequent, end, issue, outgrowth, sequel, effect, event, outcome, result, upshot.
Effect is the strongest of these words; it is that which is directly produced by the action of an efficient cause;
we say, "Every effect must have an adequate cause" (compare CAUSE). In regard to human actions, effect
commonly relates to intention; as, the shot took effect, i. e., the effect intended. A consequence is that which
follows an act naturally, but less directly than the effect. The motion of the piston is the effect, and the
agitation of the water under the paddle-wheels a consequence of the expansion of steam in the cylinder. The
result is, literally, the rebound of an act, depending on many elements; the issue is that which flows forth
directly; we say the issue of a battle, the result of a campaign. A consequent commonly is that which follows
simply in order of time, or by logical inference. The end is the actual outcome without determination of its
relation to what has gone before; it is ordinarily viewed as either the necessary, natural, or logical outcome,
any effect, consequence, or result being termed an end; as, the end of such a course must be ruin. The event
(L. e, out, and venio, come) is primarily exactly the same in meaning as outcome; but in use it is more nearly
equivalent to upshot signifying the sum and substance of all effects, consequences, and results of a course of
action. Compare ACCIDENT; CAUSE; CIRCUMSTANCE; END; EVENT.
* * * * *
CONSOLE.
Synonyms:
comfort, condole with, encourage, sympathize with.
One condoles with another by the expression of kindly sympathy in his trouble; he consoles him by
considerations adapted to soothe and sustain the spirit, as by the assurances and promises of the gospel; he
encourages him by the hope of some relief or deliverance; he comforts him by whatever act or word tends to
bring mind or body to a state of rest and cheer. We sympathize with others, not only in sorrow, but in joy.
Compare ALLEVIATE; PITY.
Antonyms:
annoy, distress, disturb, grieve, hurt, sadden, trouble, wound.
* * * * *
CONTAGION.
Synonym:
infection.
Infection is frequently confused with contagion, even by medical men. The best usage now limits contagion to
diseases that are transmitted by contact with the diseased person, either directly by touch or indirectly by use
of the same articles, by breath, effluvia, etc. Infection is applied to diseases produced by no known or
definable influence of one person upon another, but where common climatic, malarious, or other wide-spread
conditions are believed to be chiefly instrumental.
* * * * *
CONTINUAL.
Synonyms:
ceaseless, incessant, regular, uninterrupted, constant, invariable, unbroken, unremitting, continuous, perpetual,
unceasing, unvarying.
Continuous describes that which is absolutely without pause or break; continual, that which often intermits,
but as regularly begins again. A continuous beach is exposed to the continual beating of the waves. A similar
distinction is made between incessant and ceaseless. The incessant discharge of firearms makes the ceaseless
roar of battle. Constant is sometimes used in the sense of continual; but its chief uses are mental and moral.
* * * * *
CONTRACT.
Synonyms:
agreement, cartel, engagement, pledge, arrangement, compact, obligation, promise, bargain, covenant, pact,
stipulation.
All these words involve at least two parties, tho an engagement or promise may be the act of but one. A
contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties for the doing or leaving undone some specified
act or acts, and is ordinarily in writing. Mutual promises may have the force of a contract. A consideration, or
compensation, is essential to convert an agreement into a contract. A contract may be oral or written. A
covenant in law is a written contract under seal. Covenant is frequent in religious usage, as contract is in law
and business. Compact is essentially the same as contract, but is applied to international agreements, treaties,
etc. A bargain is a mutual agreement for an exchange of values, without the formality of a contract. A
stipulation is a single item in an agreement or contract. A cartel is a military agreement for the exchange of
prisoners or the like.
* * * * *
CONTRAST.
Synonyms:
compare, differentiate, discriminate, oppose.
To compare (L. con, together, and par, equal) is to place together in order to show likeness or unlikeness; to
contrast (L. contra, against, and sto, stand) is to set in opposition in order to show unlikeness. We contrast
objects that have been already compared. We must compare them, at least momentarily, even to know that
they are different. We contrast them when we observe their unlikeness in a general way; we differentiate them
when we note the difference exactly and point by point. We distinguish objects when we note a difference that
may fall short of contrast; we discriminate them when we classify or place them according to their
differences.
Preposition:
We contrast one object with another.
* * * * *
CONVERSATION.
Synonyms:
chat, communion, converse, intercourse, colloquy, confabulation, dialogue, parley, communication,
conference, discourse, talk.
Conversation (Latin con, with) is, etymologically, an interchange of ideas with some other person or persons.
Talk may be wholly one-sided. Many brilliant talkers have been incapable of conversation. There may be
intercourse without conversation, as by looks, signs, etc.; communion is of hearts, with or without words;
communication is often by writing, and may be uninvited and unreciprocated. Talk may denote the mere
utterance of words with little thought; thus, we say idle talk, empty talk, rather than idle or empty
conversation. Discourse is now applied chiefly to public addresses. A conference is more formal than a
conversation. Dialog denotes ordinarily an artificial or imaginary conversation, generally of two persons, but
sometimes of more. A colloquy is indefinite as to number, and generally somewhat informal. Compare
BEHAVIOR.
Prepositions:
Conversation with friends; between or among the guests; about a matter.
* * * * *
CONVERT.
Synonyms:
disciple, neophyte, proselyte.
The name disciple is given to the follower of a certain faith, without reference to any previous belief or
allegiance; a convert is a person who has come to one faith from a different belief or from unbelief. A
proselyte is one who has been led to accept a religious system, whether with or without true faith; a convert is
always understood to be a believer. A neophyte is a new convert, not yet fully indoctrinated, or not admitted to
full privileges. The antonyms apostate, pervert, and renegade are condemnatory names applied to the convert
by those whose faith he forsakes.
* * * * *
CONVEY.
Synonyms:
carry, give, remove, shift, transmit, change, move, sell, transfer, transport.
Convey, transmit, and transport all imply delivery at a destination; as, I will convey the information to your
friend; air conveys sound (to a listener); carry does not necessarily imply delivery, and often does not admit of
it. A man carries an appearance, conveys an impression, the appearance remaining his own, the impression
being given to another; I will transmit the letter; transport the goods. A horse carries his mane and tail, but
does not convey them. Transfer may or may not imply delivery to another person; as, items may be
transferred from one account to another or a word transferred to the following line. In law, real estate, which
can not be moved, is conveyed by simply transferring title and possession. Transport usually refers to
material, transfer, transmit, and convey may refer to immaterial objects; we transfer possession, transmit
intelligence, convey ideas, but do not transport them. In the case of convey the figurative sense now
predominates. Compare CARRY.
Antonyms:
cling to, hold, keep, possess, preserve, retain.
Prepositions:
Convey to a friend, a purchaser, etc.; convey from the house to the station; convey by express, by hand, etc.
* * * * *
CONVOKE.
Synonyms:
assemble, call together, convene, muster, call, collect, gather, summon.
A convention is called by some officer or officers, as by its president, its executive committee, or some
eminent leaders; the delegates are assembled or convened in a certain place, at a certain hour. Convoke implies
an organized body and a superior authority; assemble and convene express more independent action;
Parliament is convoked; Congress assembles. Troops are mustered; witnesses and jurymen are summoned.
Antonyms:
adjourn, disband, dismiss, dissolve, scatter, break up, discharge, disperse, prorogue, separate.
* * * * *
CRIMINAL.
Synonyms:
abominable, flagitious, immoral, sinful, vile, culpable, guilty, iniquitous, unlawful, wicked, felonious, illegal,
nefarious, vicious, wrong.
Every criminal act is illegal or unlawful, but illegal or unlawful acts may not be criminal. Offenses against
public law are criminal; offenses against private rights are merely illegal or unlawful. As a general rule, all
acts punishable by fine or imprisonment or both, are criminal in view of the law. It is illegal for a man to
trespass on another's land, but it is not criminal; the trespasser is liable to a civil suit for damages, but not to
indictment, fine, or imprisonment. A felonious act is a criminal act of an aggravated kind, which is punishable
by imprisonment in the penitentiary or by death. A flagitious crime is one that brings public odium. Vicious
refers to the indulgence of evil appetites, habits, or passions; vicious acts are not necessarily criminal, or even
illegal; we speak of a vicious horse. That which is iniquitous, i. e., contrary to equity, may sometimes be done
under the forms of law. Ingratitude is sinful, hypocrisy is wicked, but neither is punishable by human law;
hence, neither is criminal or illegal. Compare SIN.
Antonyms:
innocent, lawful, meritorious, right, just, legal, moral, virtuous.
* * * * *
DAILY.
Synonym:
diurnal.
Daily is the Saxon and popular, diurnal the Latin and scientific term. In strict usage, daily is the antonym of
nightly as diurnal is of nocturnal. Daily is not, however, held strictly to this use; a physician makes daily
visits if he calls at some time within each period of twenty-four hours. Diurnal is more exact in all its uses; a
diurnal flower opens or blooms only in daylight; a diurnal bird or animal flies or ranges only by day: in
contradistinction to nocturnal flowers, birds, etc. A diurnal motion exactly fills an astronomical day or the
time of one rotation of a planet on its axis, while a daily motion is much less definite.
Antonyms:
nightly, nocturnal.
* * * * *
DANGER.
Synonyms:
hazard, insecurity, jeopardy, peril, risk.
Danger is exposure to possible evil, which may be either near and probable or remote and doubtful; peril is
exposure to imminent and sharply threatening evil, especially to such as results from violence. An invalid may
be in danger of consumption; a disarmed soldier is in peril of death. Jeopardy is nearly the same as peril, but
involves, like risk, more of the element of chance or uncertainty; a man tried upon a capital charge is said to
be put in jeopardy of life. Insecurity is a feeble word, but exceedingly broad, applying to the placing of a dish,
or the possibilities of a life, a fortune, or a government. Compare HAZARD.
Antonyms:
defense, immunity, protection, safeguard, safety, security, shelter.
* * * * *
DARK.
Synonyms:
black, dusky, mysterious, sable, somber, dim, gloomy, obscure, shadowy, swart, dismal, murky, opaque,
shady, swarthy.
Strictly, that which is black is absolutely destitute of color; that which is dark is absolutely destitute of light.
In common speech, however, a coat is black, tho not optically colorless; the night is dark, tho the stars shine.
That is obscure, shadowy, or shady from which the light is more or less cut off. Dusky is applied to objects
which appear as if viewed in fading light; the word is often used, as are swart and swarthy, of the human skin
when quite dark, or even verging toward black. Dim refers to imperfection of outline, from distance, darkness,
mist, etc., or from some defect of vision. Opaque objects, as smoked glass, are impervious to light. Murky is
said of that which is at once dark, obscure, and gloomy; as, a murky den; a murky sky. Figuratively, dark is
emblematic of sadness, agreeing with somber, dismal, gloomy, also of moral evil; as, a dark deed. Of
intellectual matters, dark is now rarely used in the old sense of a dark saying, etc. See MYSTERIOUS;
OBSCURE.
Antonyms:
bright, crystalline, glowing, lucid, shining, brilliant, dazzling, illumined, luminous, transparent, clear,
gleaming, light, radiant, white.
Compare synonyms for LIGHT.
* * * * *
DECAY.
Synonyms:
corrupt, decompose, molder, putrefy, rot, spoil.
Rot is a strong word, ordinarily esteemed coarse, but on occasion capable of approved emphatic use; as, "the
name of the wicked shall rot," Prov. x, 7; decay and decompose are now common euphemisms. A substance is
decomposed when resolved into its original elements by any process; it is decayed when resolved into its
original elements by natural processes; it decays gradually, but may be instantly decomposed, as water into
oxygen and hydrogen; to say that a thing is decayed may denote only a partial result, but to say it is
decomposed ordinarily implies that the change is complete or nearly so. Putrefy and the adjectives putrid and
putrescent, and the nouns putridity and putrescence, are used almost exclusively of animal matter in a state of
decomposition, the more general word decay being used of either animal or vegetable substances.
* * * * *
DECEPTION.
Synonyms:
craft, dissimulation, finesse, lie, cunning, double-dealing, fraud, lying, deceit, duplicity, guile, prevarication,
deceitfulness, fabrication, hypocrisy, trickery, delusion, falsehood, imposition, untruth.
Deceit is the habit, deception the act; guile applies to the disposition out of which deceit and deception grow,
and also to their actual practise. A lie, lying, or falsehood, is the uttering of what one knows to be false with
intent to deceive. The novel or drama is not a lie, because not meant to deceive; the ancient teaching that the
earth was flat was not a lie, because not then known to be false. Untruth is more than lack of accuracy,
implying always lack of veracity; but it is a somewhat milder and more dignified word than lie. Falsehood
and lying are in utterance; deceit and deception may be merely in act or implication. Deception may be
innocent, and even unintentional, as in the case of an optical illusion; deceit always involves injurious intent.
Craft and cunning have not necessarily any moral quality; they are common traits of animals, but stand rather
low in the human scale. Duplicity is the habitual speaking or acting with intent to appear to mean what one
does not. Dissimulation is rather a concealing of what is than a pretense of what is not. Finesse is simply an
adroit and delicate management of a matter for one's own side, not necessarily involving deceit. Compare
ARTIFICE; FICTION; FRAUD; HYPOCRISY.
Antonyms:
candor, frankness, honesty, simplicity, truth, fair dealing, guilelessness, openness, sincerity, veracity.
* * * * *
DEFENSE.
Synonyms:
apology, guard, rampart, shelter, bulwark, justification, resistance, shield, fortress, protection, safeguard,
vindication.
The weak may speak or act in defense of the strong; none but the powerful can assure others of protection. A
defense is ordinarily against actual attack; protection is against possible as well as actual dangers. We speak of
defense against an assault, protection from the cold. Vindication is a triumphant defense of character and
conduct against charges of error or wrong. Compare APOLOGY.
Antonyms:
abandonment, betrayal, capitulation, desertion, flight, surrender.
Prepositions:
Defense against assault or assailants; in law, defense to an action, from the testimony.
* * * * *
DEFILE.
Synonyms:
befoul, corrupt, pollute, spoil, sully, tarnish, contaminate, infect, soil, stain, taint, vitiate.
The hand may be defiled by a touch of pitch; swine that have been wallowing in the mud are befouled.
Contaminate and infect refer to something evil that deeply pervades and permeates, as the human body or
mind. Pollute is used chiefly of liquids; as, water polluted with sewage. Tainted meat is repulsive; infected
meat contains germs of disease. A soiled garment may be cleansed by washing; a spoiled garment is beyond
cleansing or repair. Bright metal is tarnished by exposure; a fair sheet is sullied by a dirty hand. In figurative
use, defile may be used merely in the ceremonial sense; "they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest
they should be defiled," John xviii, 28; contaminate refers to deep spiritual injury. Pollute has also a reference
to sacrilege; as, to pollute a sanctuary, an altar, or an ordinance. The innocent are often contaminated by
association with the wicked; the vicious are more and more corrupted by their own excesses. We speak of a
vitiated taste or style; fraud vitiates a title or a contract.
Antonyms:
clean, cleanse, disinfect, hallow, purify, sanctify, wash.
Prepositions:
The temple was defiled with blood; defiled by sacrilegious deeds.
* * * * *
DEFINITION.
Synonyms:
comment, description, exposition, rendering, commentary, explanation, interpretation, translation.
A definition is exact, an explanation general; a definition is formal, a description pictorial. A definition must
include all that belongs to the object defined, and exclude all that does not; a description may include only
some general features; an explanation may simply throw light upon some point of special difficulty. An
exposition undertakes to state more fully what is compactly given or only implied in the text; as, an exposition
of Scripture. Interpretation is ordinarily from one language into another, or from the language of one period
into that of another; it may also be a statement giving the doubtful or hidden meaning of that which is
recondite or perplexing; as, the interpretation of a dream, a riddle, or of some difficult passage. Definition,
explanation, exposition, and interpretation are ordinarily blended in a commentary, which may also include
description. A comment is upon a single passage; a commentary may be the same, but is usually understood to
be a volume of comments.
* * * * *
DELEGATE.
Synonyms:
deputy, legate, proxy, representative, substitute.
These words agree in designating one who acts in the place of some other or others. The legate is an
ecclesiastical officer representing the Pope. In strict usage the deputy or delegate is more limited in functions
and more closely bound by instructions than a representative. A single officer may have a deputy; many
persons combine to choose a delegate or representative. In the United States informal assemblies send
delegates to nominating conventions with no legislative authority; representatives are legally elected to
Congress and the various legislatures, with lawmaking power.
* * * * *
DELIBERATE.
Synonyms:
confer, consult, meditate, reflect, consider, debate, ponder, weigh.
An individual considers, meditates, ponders, reflects, by himself; he weighs a matter in his own mind, and is
sometimes said even to debate with himself. Consult and confer always imply two or more persons, as does
debate, unless expressly limited as above. Confer suggests the interchange of counsel, advice, or information;
consult indicates almost exclusively the receiving of it. A man confers with his associates about a new
investment; he consults his physician about his health; he may confer with him on matters of general interest.
He consults a dictionary, but does not confer with it. Deliberate, which can be applied to a single individual,
is also the word for a great number, while consult is ordinarily limited to a few; a committee consults; an
assembly deliberates. Deliberating always carries the idea of slowness; consulting is compatible with haste;
we can speak of a hasty consultation, not of a hasty deliberation. Debate implies opposing views; deliberate,
simply a gathering and balancing of all facts and reasons. We consider or deliberate with a view to action,
while meditation may be quite purposeless.
Prepositions:
We deliberate on or upon, also about or concerning a matter: the first two are preferable.
* * * * *
DELICIOUS.
Synonyms:
dainty, delightful, exquisite, luscious, savory.
That is delicious which affords a gratification at once vivid and delicate to the senses, especially to those of
taste and smell; as, delicious fruit; a delicious odor; luscious has a kindred but more fulsome meaning,
inclining toward a cloying excess of sweetness or richness. Savory is applied chiefly to cooked food made
palatable by spices and condiments. Delightful may be applied to the higher gratifications of sense, as
delightful music, but is chiefly used for that which is mental and spiritual. Delicious has a limited use in this

delicious! Compare DELIGHTFUL.

DELIGHTFUL.
Synonyms:
acceptable, delicious, pleasant, refreshing, agreeable, grateful, pleasing, satisfying, congenial, gratifying,
pleasurable, welcome.
Agreeable refers to whatever gives a mild degree of pleasure; as, an agreeable perfume. Acceptable indicates
a thing to be worthy of acceptance; as, an acceptable offering. Grateful is stronger than agreeable or
gratifying, indicating whatever awakens a feeling akin to gratitude. A pleasant face and pleasing manners
arouse pleasurable sensations, and make the possessor an agreeable companion; if possessed of intelligence,
vivacity, and goodness, such a person's society will be delightful. Criminals may find each other's company
congenial, but scarcely delightful. Satisfying denotes anything that is received with calm acquiescence, as
substantial food, or established truth. That is welcome which is received with joyful heartiness; as, welcome
tidings. Compare BEAUTIFUL; CHARMING; DELICIOUS.
Antonyms:
depressing, hateful, miserable, painful, woful, disappointing, horrible, mournful, saddening, wretched.
distressing, melancholy,

DELUSION.
Synonyms:
error, fallacy, hallucination, illusion, phantasm.
A delusion is a mistaken conviction, an illusion a mistaken perception or inference. An illusion may be wholly
of the senses; a delusion always involves some mental error. In an optical illusion the observer sees either
what does not exist, or what exists otherwise than as he sees it, as when in a mirage distant springs and trees
appear close at hand. We speak of the illusions of fancy or of hope, but of the delusions of the insane. A
hallucination is a false image or belief which has nothing, outside of the disordered mind, to suggest it; as, the
hallucinations of delirium tremens. Compare DECEPTION; INSANITY.
Antonyms:
actuality, certainty, fact, reality, truth, verity.
* * * * *
DEMOLISH.
Synonyms:
destroy, overthrow, overturn, raze, ruin.
A building, monument, or other structure is demolished when reduced to a shapeless mass; it is razed when
leveled with the ground; it is destroyed when its structural unity is gone, whether or not its component parts
remain. An edifice is destroyed by fire or earthquake; it is demolished by bombardment; it is ruined when, by
violence or neglect, it has become unfit for human habitation. Compare ABOLISH; BREAK.
Antonyms:
build, construct, create, make, repair, restore.
* * * * *
DEMONSTRATION.
Synonyms:
certainty, consequence, evidence, inference, conclusion, deduction, induction, proof.
Demonstration, in the strict and proper sense, is the highest form of proof, and gives the most absolute
certainty, but can not be applied outside of pure mathematics or other strictly deductive reasoning; there can
be proof and certainty, however, in matters that do not admit of demonstration. A conclusion is the absolute
and necessary result of the admission of certain premises; an inference is a probable conclusion toward which
known facts, statements, or admissions point, but which they do not absolutely establish; sound premises,
together with their necessary conclusion, constitute a demonstration. Evidence is that which tends to show a
thing to be true; in the widest sense, as including self-evidence or consciousness, it is the basis of all
knowledge. Proof in the strict sense is complete, irresistible evidence; as, there was much evidence against the
accused, but not amounting to proof of guilt. Moral certainty is a conviction resting on such evidence as puts a
matter beyond reasonable doubt, while not so irresistible as demonstration. Compare HYPOTHESIS;
INDUCTION.
* * * * *
DESIGN.
Synonyms:
aim, final cause, object, proposal, device, intent, plan, purpose, end, intention, project, scheme.
Design refers to the adaptation of means to an end, the correspondence and coordination of parts, or of
separate acts, to produce a result; intent and purpose overleap all particulars, and fasten on the end itself.
Intention is simply the more familiar form of the legal and philosophical intent. Plan relates to details of form,
structure, and action, in themselves; design considers these same details all as a means to an end. The plan of
a campaign may be for a series of sharp attacks, with the design of thus surprising and overpowering the
enemy. A man comes to a fixed intention to kill his enemy; he forms a plan to entrap him into his power, with
the design of then compassing his death; as the law can not read the heart, it can only infer the intent from the
evidences of design. Intent denotes a straining, stretching forth toward an object; purpose simply the placing it
before oneself; hence, we speak of the purpose rather than the intent or intention of God. We hold that the
marks of design in nature prove it the work of a great Designer. Intention contemplates the possibility of
failure; purpose looks to assured success; intent or intention refers especially to the state of mind of the actor;
purpose to the result of the action. Compare AIM; CAUSE; IDEA; MODEL.
Prepositions:
The design of defrauding; the design of a building; a design for a statue.
* * * * *
DESIRE.
Synonyms:
appetency, concupiscence, hankering, proclivity, appetite, coveting, inclination, propensity, aspiration,
craving, longing, wish.
Inclination is the mildest of these terms; it is a quiet, or even a vague or unconscious, tendency. Even when
we speak of a strong or decided inclination we do not express the intensity of desire. Desire has a wide range,
from the highest objects to the lowest; desire is for an object near at hand, or near in thought, and viewed as
attainable; a wish may be for what is remote or uncertain, or even for what is recognized as impossible.
Craving is stronger than hankering; hankering may be the result of a fitful and capricious appetite; craving
may be the imperious and reasonable demand of the whole nature. Longing is a reaching out with deep and
persistent demand for that which is viewed as now distant but at some time attainable; as, the captive's longing
for release. Coveting ordinarily denotes wrong desire for that which is another's. Compare APPETITE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ANTIPATHY.
Prepositions:
The desire of fame; a desire for excellence.
* * * * *
DESPAIR.
Synonyms:
desperation, despondency, discouragement, hopelessness.
Discouragement is the result of so much repulse or failure as wears out courage. Discouragements too
frequent and long continued may produce a settled hopelessness. Hopelessness is negative, and may result
from simple apathy; despondency and despair are more emphatic and decided. Despondency is an incapacity
for the present exercise of hope; despair is the utter abandonment of hope. Despondency relaxes energy and
effort and is always attended with sadness or distress; despair may produce a stony calmness, or it may lead to
desperation. Desperation is energized despair, vigorous in action, reckless of consequences.
Antonyms:
anticipation, confidence, encouragement, expectation, hopefulness, assurance, courage, expectancy, hope,
trust. cheer, elation,
* * * * *
DEXTERITY.
Synonyms:
adroitness, aptitude, cleverness, expertness, readiness, skill.
Adroitness (F. , to, and droit, right) and dexterity (L. dexter, right, right-hand) might each be rendered
"right-handedness;" but adroitness carries more of the idea of eluding, parrying, or checking some hostile
movement, or taking advantage of another in controversy; dexterity conveys the idea of doing, accomplishing
something readily and well, without reference to any action of others. We speak of adroitness in fencing,
boxing, or debate; of dexterity in horsemanship, in the use of tools, weapons, etc. Aptitude (L. aptus, fit,
fitted) is a natural readiness, which by practise may be developed into dexterity. Skill is more exact to line,
rule, and method than dexterity. Dexterity can not be communicated, and, oftentimes can not even be
explained by its possessor; skill to a very great extent can be imparted; "skilled workmen" in various trades are
numbered by thousands. Compare ADDRESS; CLEVER; POWER; SKILFUL.
Prepositions:
Dexterity of hand, of movement, of management; with the pen; in action, in manipulating men; at cards.
* * * * *
DICTION.
Synonyms:
expression, phrase, style, vocabulary, language, phraseology, verbiage, wording.
An author's diction is strictly his choice and use of words, with no special reference to thought; expression
regards the words simply as the vehicle of the thought. Phrase and phraseology apply to words or
combinations of words which are somewhat technical; as, in legal phraseology; in military phrase. Diction is
general; wording is limited; we speak of the diction of an author or of a work, the wording of a proposition, of
a resolution, etc. Verbiage never bears this sense (see CIRCUMLOCUTION.) The language of a writer or
speaker may be the national speech he employs; as, the English or French language; or the word may denote
his use of that language; as, the author's language is well (or ill) chosen. Style includes diction, expression,
rhetorical figures such as metaphor and simile, the effect of an author's prevailing tone of thought, of his
personal traits--in short, all that makes up the clothing of thought in words; thus, we speak of a figurative
style, a frigid or an argumentative style, etc., or of the style of Macaulay, Prescott, or others. An author's
vocabulary is the range of words which he brings into his use. Compare LANGUAGE.
* * * * *
DIE.
Synonyms:
cease, decline, expire, perish, decease, depart, fade, wither.
Die, to go out of life, become destitute of vital power and action, is figuratively applied to anything which has
the appearance of life.
Where the dying night-lamp flickers.
TENNYSON Locksley Hall st. 40.
An echo, a strain of music, a tempest, a topic, an issue, dies. Expire (literally, to breathe out) is a softer word
for die; it is used figuratively of things that cease to exist by reaching a natural limit; as, a lease expires; the
time has expired. To perish (literally, in Latin, to go through, as in English we say, "the fire goes out") is
oftenest used of death by privation or exposure; as, "I perish with hunger," Luke xv, 17; sometimes, of death
by violence. Knowledge and fame, art and empires, may be said to perish; the word denotes utter destruction
and decay.
Antonyms:
be born, come into being, flourish, rise again, begin, come to life, grow, rise from the dead, be immortal, exist,
live, survive.
Prepositions:
To die of fever; by violence; rarely, with the sword, famine, etc. (Ezek. vii, 15); to die for one's country; to die
at sea; in one's bed; in agony; die to the world.
* * * * *
DIFFERENCE.
Synonyms:
contrariety, discrimination, distinction, inequality, contrast, disparity, divergence, unlikeness, disagreement,
dissimilarity, diversity, variation, discrepancy, dissimilitude, inconsistency, variety.
Difference is the state or quality of being unlike or the amount of such unlikeness. A difference is in the things
compared; a discrimination is in our judgment of them; a distinction is in our definition or description or
mental image of them. Careful discrimination of real differences results in clear distinctions. Disparity is
stronger than inequality, implying that one thing falls far below another; as, the disparity of our achievements
when compared with our ideals. Dissimilarity is between things sharply contrasted; there may be a difference
between those almost alike. There is a discrepancy in accounts that fail to balance. Variety involves more than
two objects; so, in general, does diversity; variation is a difference in the condition or action of the same
object at different times. Disagreement is not merely the lack, but the opposite, of agreement; it is a mild word
for opposition and conflict; difference is sometimes used in the same sense.
Antonyms:
agreement, harmony, likeness, sameness, uniformity, consonance, identity, resemblance, similarity, unity.
Prepositions:
Difference between the old and the new; differences among men; a difference in character; of action; of style;
(less frequently) a difference (controversy) with a person; a difference of one thing from (incorrectly to)
another.
* * * * *
DIFFICULT.
Synonyms:
arduous, hard, onerous, toilsome, exhausting, laborious, severe, trying.
Arduous (L. arduus, steep) signifies primarily so steep and lofty as to be difficult of ascent, and hence applies
to that which involves great and sustained exertion and ordinarily for a lofty aim; great learning can only be
won by arduous toil. Hard applies to anything that resists our endeavors as a scarcely penetrable mass resists
our physical force. Anything is hard that involves tax and strain whether of the physical or mental powers.
Difficult is not used of that which merely taxes physical force; a dead lift is called hard rather than difficult;
breaking stone on the road would be called hard rather than difficult work; that is difficult which involves
skill, sagacity, or address, with or without a considerable expenditure of physical force; a geometrical problem
may be difficult to solve, a tangled skein to unravel; a mountain difficult to ascend. Hard may be active or
passive; a thing may be hard to do or hard to bear. Arduous is always active. That which is laborious or
toilsome simply requires the steady application of labor or toil till accomplished; toilsome is the stronger
word. That which is onerous (L. onus, a burden) is mentally burdensome or oppressive. Responsibility may be
onerous even when it involves no special exertion.
Antonyms:
easy, facile, light, pleasant, slight, trifling, trivial.
* * * * *
DIRECTION.
Synonyms:
aim, bearing, course, inclination, tendency, way.
The direction of an object is the line of motion or of vision toward it, or the line in which the object is
moving, considered from our own actual or mental standpoint. Way, literally the road or path, comes naturally
to mean the direction of the road or path; conversationally, way is almost a perfect synonym of direction; as,
which way did he go? or, in which direction? Bearing is the direction in which an object is seen with
reference to another, and especially with reference to the points of the compass. Course is the direction of a
moving object; inclination, that toward which a stationary object leans; tendency, the direction toward which
anything stretches or reaches out; tendency is stronger and more active than inclination. Compare AIM;
CARE; ORDER; OVERSIGHT.
* * * * *
DISCERN.
Synonyms:
behold, discriminate, observe, recognize, descry, distinguish, perceive, see.
What we discern we see apart from all other objects; what we discriminate we judge apart; what we
distinguish we mark apart, or recognize by some special mark or manifest difference. We discriminate by real
differences; we distinguish by outward signs; an officer is readily distinguished from a common soldier by his
uniform. Objects may be dimly discerned at twilight, when yet we can not clearly distinguish one from
another. We descry (originally espy) what is difficult to discover. Compare DISCOVER; LOOK.
* * * * *
DISCOVER.
Synonyms:
ascertain, detect, disclose, ferret out, find out, descry, discern, expose, find, invent.
Of human actions or character, detect is used, almost without exception, in a bad sense; discover may be used
in either the good or the bad sense, oftener in the good; he was detected in a fraud; real merit is sure to be
discovered. In scientific language, detect is used of delicate indications that appear in course of careful
watching; as, a slight fluttering of the pulse could be detected. We discover what has existed but has not been
known to us; we invent combinations or arrangements not before in use; Columbus discovered America;
Morse invented the electric telegraph. Find is the most general word for every means of coming to know what
was not before certainly known. A man finds in the road some stranger's purse, or finds his own which he is
searching for. The expert discovers or detects an error in an account; the auditor finds the account to be
correct. Compare DISCERN.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for HIDE.
* * * * *
DISEASE.
Synonyms:
affection, disorder, indisposition, sickness, ailment, distemper, infirmity, unhealthiness, complaint, illness,
malady, unsoundness.
Disease is the general term for any deviation from health; in a more limited sense it denotes some definite
morbid condition; disorder and affection are rather partial and limited; as, a nervous affection; a disorder of
the digestive system. Sickness was generally used in English speech and literature, till the close of the
eighteenth century at least, for every form of physical disorder, as abundantly appears in the English Bible:
"Jesus went about ... healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people," Matt. iv, 23;
"Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died," 2 Kings xiii, 14. There is now, in England, a tendency
to restrict the words sick and sickness to nausea, or "sickness at the stomach," and to hold ill and illness as the
only proper words to use in a general sense. This distinction has received but a very limited acceptance in the
United States, where sick and sickness have the earlier and wider usage. We speak of trifling ailments, a slight
indisposition, a serious or a deadly disease; a slight or severe illness; a painful sickness. Complaint is a
popular term, which may be applied to any degree of ill health, slight or severe. Infirmity denotes a chronic or
lingering weakness or disability, as blindness or lameness.
Antonyms:
health, robustness, soundness, strength, sturdiness, vigor.
* * * * *
DISPARAGE.
Synonyms:
belittle, depreciate, discredit, underestimate, carp at, derogate from, dishonor, underrate, decry, detract from,
lower, undervalue.
To decry is to cry down, in some noisy, public, or conspicuous manner. A witness or a statement is
discredited; the currency is depreciated; a good name is dishonored by unworthy conduct; we underestimate
in our own minds; we may underrate or undervalue in statement to others. These words are used, with few
exceptions, of things such as qualities, merits, attainments, etc. To disparage is to belittle by damaging
comparison or suggestion; it is used only of things. A man's achievements are disparaged, his motives
depreciated, his professions discredited; he himself is calumniated, slandered, etc. Compare SLANDER.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for PRAISE.
* * * * *
DISPLACE.
Synonyms:
confuse, derange, disturb, mislay, remove, crowd out, disarrange, jumble, misplace, unsettle.
Objects are displaced when moved out of the place they have occupied; they are misplaced when put into a
place where they should not be. One may know where to find what he has misplaced; what he has mislaid he
can not locate.
Antonyms:
adjust, assort, dispose, order, put in order, set in order, array, classify, group, place, put in place, sort.
* * * * *
DO.
Synonyms:
accomplish, carry out, discharge, perform, achieve, carry through, effect, perpetrate, actualize, commit,
execute, realize, bring about, complete, finish, transact, bring to pass, consummate, fulfil, work out.
Do is the one comprehensive word which includes this whole class. We may say of the least item of daily
work, "It is done," and of the grandest human achievement, "Well done!" Finish and complete signify to bring
to an end what was previously begun; there is frequently the difference in usage that finish is applied to the
fine details and is superficial, while complete is comprehensive, being applied to the whole ideal, plan, and
execution; as, to finish a statue; to complete a scheme of philosophy. To discharge is to do what is given in
charge, expected, or required; as, to discharge the duties of the office. To fulfil is to do or to be what has been
promised, expected, hoped, or desired; as, a son fulfils a father's hopes. Realize, effect, execute, and
consummate all signify to embody in fact what was before in thought. One may realize that which he has done
nothing to bring about; he may realize the dreams of youth by inheriting a fortune; but he can not effect his
early designs except by doing the utmost that is necessary to make them fact. Effect includes all that is done to
accomplish the intent; execute refers rather to the final steps; consummate is limited quite sharply to the
concluding act. An officer executes the law when he proceeds against its violators; a purchase is consummated
when the money is paid and the property delivered. Execute refers more commonly to the commands of
another, effect and consummate to one's own designs; as, the commander effected the capture of the fort,
because his officers and men promptly executed his commands. Achieve--to do something worthy of a
chief--signifies always to perform some great and generally some worthy exploit. Perform and accomplish
both imply working toward the end; but perform always allows a possibility of not attaining, while
accomplish carries the thought of full completion. In Longfellow's lines, "Patience; accomplish thy labor,"
etc., perform could not be substituted without great loss. As between complete and accomplish, complete
considers rather the thing as done; accomplish, the whole process of doing it. Commit, as applied to actions, is
used only of those that are bad, whether grave or trivial; perpetrate is used chiefly of aggravated crimes or,
somewhat humorously, of blunders. A man may commit a sin, a trespass, or a murder; perpetrate an outrage
or a felony. We finish a garment or a letter, complete an edifice or a life-work, consummate a bargain or a
crime, discharge a duty, effect a purpose, execute a command, fulfil a promise, perform our daily tasks, realize
an ideal, accomplish a design, achieve a victory. Compare TRANSACT; TRANSACTION.
Antonyms:
baffle, defeat, fail, mar, miss, ruin, come short, destroy, frustrate, miscarry, neglect, spoil.

DOCILE.
Synonyms:
amenable, manageable, pliant, teachable, compliant, obedient, submissive, tractable, gentle, pliable, tame,
yielding.
One who is docile is easily taught; one who is tractable is easily led; one who is pliant is easily bent in any
direction; compliant represents one as inclined or persuaded to agreement with another's will. Compare
DUTY.
Antonyms:
determined, inflexible, opinionated, self-willed, wilful, dogged, intractable, resolute, stubborn, unyielding.
firm, obstinate,
* * * * *
DOCTRINE.
Synonyms:
article of belief, belief, precept, teaching, article of faith, dogma, principle, tenet.
Doctrine primarily signifies that which is taught; principle, the fundamental basis on which the teaching rests.
A doctrine is reasoned out, and may be defended by reasoning; a dogma rests on authority, as of direct
revelation, the decision of the church, etc. A doctrine or dogma is a statement of some one item of belief; a
creed is a summary of doctrines or dogmas. Dogma has commonly, at the present day, an offensive
signification, as of a belief arrogantly asserted. Tenet is simply that which is held, and is applied to a single
item of belief; it is a neutral word, neither approving nor condemning; we speak of the doctrines of our own
church; of the tenets of others. A precept relates not to belief, but to conduct. Compare FAITH; LAW.
* * * * *
DOGMATIC.
Synonyms:
arrogant, doctrinal, magisterial, positive, authoritative, domineering, opinionated, self-opinionated, dictatorial,
imperious, overbearing, systematic.
Dogmatic is technically applied in a good sense to that which is formally enunciated by adequate authority;
doctrinal to that which is stated in the form of doctrine to be taught or defended. Dogmatic theology, called
also "dogmatics," gives definite propositions, which it holds to be delivered by authority; systematic theology
considers the same propositions in their logical connection and order as parts of a system; a doctrinal
statement is less absolute in its claims than a dogmatic treatise, and may be more partial than the term
systematic would imply. Outside of theology, dogmatic has generally an offensive sense; a dogmatic
statement is one for which the author does not trouble himself to give a reason, either because of the strength
of his convictions, or because of his contempt for those whom he addresses; thus dogmatic is, in common use,
allied with arrogant and kindred words.
* * * * *
DOUBT, v.
Synonyms:
distrust, mistrust, surmise, suspect.
To doubt is to lack conviction. Incompleteness of evidence may compel one to doubt, or some perverse bias of
mind may incline him to. Distrust may express simply a lack of confidence; as, I distrust my own judgment;
or it may be nearly equivalent to suspect; as, I distrusted that man from the start. Mistrust and suspect imply
that one is almost assured of positive evil; one may distrust himself or others; he suspects others. Mistrust is
now rarely, if ever, used of persons, but only of motives, intentions, etc. Distrust is always serious; mistrust is
often used playfully. Compare SUPPOSE. Compare synonyms for DOUBT, n.
Antonyms:
believe, depend on, depend upon, rely on, rely upon, trust. confide in,
* * * * *
DOUBT, n.
Synonyms:
disbelief, incredulity, perplexity, suspense, distrust, indecision, question, suspicion, hesitancy, irresolution,
scruple, unbelief, hesitation, misgiving, skepticism, uncertainty.
Doubt is a lack of conviction that may refer either to matters of belief or to matters of practise. As regards
belief, while doubt is lack of conviction, disbelief is conviction, to the contrary; unbelief refers to a settled
state of mind, generally accompanied with opposition of heart. Perplexity is active and painful; doubt may be
quiescent. Perplexity presses toward a solution; doubt may be content to linger unresolved. Any improbable
statement awakens incredulity. In theological usage unbelief and skepticism have a condemnatory force, as
implying wilful rejection of manifest truth. As regards practical matters, uncertainty applies to the unknown
or undecided; doubt implies some negative evidence. Suspense regards the future, and is eager and anxious;
uncertainty may relate to any period, and be quite indifferent. Misgiving is ordinarily in regard to the outcome
of something already done or decided; hesitation, indecision, and irresolution have reference to something
that remains to be decided or done, and are due oftener to infirmity of will than to lack of knowledge. Distrust
and suspicion apply especially to the motives, character, etc., of others, and are more decidedly adverse than
doubt. Scruple relates to matters of conscience and duty.
Antonyms:
assurance, certainty, conviction, determination, resolution, belief, confidence, decision, persuasion, resolve.
* * * * *
DRAW.
Synonyms:
allure, drag, haul, induce, lure, tow, attract, entice, incline, lead, pull, tug.
One object draws another when it moves it toward itself or in the direction of its own motion by the exertion
of adequate force, whether slight or powerful. To attract is to exert a force that tends to draw, tho it may
produce no actual motion; all objects are attracted toward the earth, tho they may be sustained from falling.
To drag is to draw against strong resistance; as, to drag a sled over bare ground, or a carriage up a steep hill.
To pull is to exert a drawing force, whether adequate or inadequate; as, the fish pulls on the line; a dentist
pulls a tooth. To tug is to draw, or try to draw, a resisting object with a continuous straining motion; as, to tug
at the oar. To haul is to draw somewhat slowly a heavy object; as, to haul a seine; to haul logs. One vessel
tows another. In the figurative sense, attract is more nearly akin to incline, draw to induce. We are attracted
by one's appearance, drawn to his side. Compare ALLURE; ARRAY; INFLUENCE.
Antonyms:
alienate, estrange, rebuff, reject, repel, repulse.
See synonyms for DRIVE.
Prepositions:
To draw water from or out of the well; draw the boat through the water, to the shore; draw air into the lungs;
draw with cords of love; the wagon is drawn by horses, along the road, across the field, over the stones,
through the woods, to the barn.
* * * * *
DREAM.
Synonyms:
day-dream, fantasy, reverie, trance, fancy, hallucination, romance, vision.
A dream is strictly a train of thoughts, fantasies, and images passing through the mind during sleep; a vision
may occur when one is awake, and in clear exercise of the senses and mental powers; vision is often applied to
something seen by the mind through supernatural agency, whether in sleep or wakefulness, conceived as more
real and authoritative than a dream; a trance is an abnormal state, which is different from normal sleep or
wakefulness. A reverie is a purposeless drifting of the mind when awake, under the influence of mental
images; a day-dream that which passes before the mind in such condition. A fancy is some image presented to
the mind, often in the fullest exercise of its powers. Hallucination is the seeming perception of non-existent
objects, as in insanity or delirium. In the figurative sense, we speak of dreams of fortune, visions of glory,
with little difference of meaning except that the vision is thought of as fuller and more vivid. We speak of a
trance of delight when the emotion almost sweeps one away from the normal exercise of the faculties.
Antonyms:
certainty, fact, reality, realization, substance, verity.
* * * * *
DRESS.
Synonyms:
apparel, clothes, garb, habit, uniform, array, clothing, garments, raiment, vestments, attire, costume,
habiliments, robes, vesture.
Clothing denotes the entire covering of the body, taken as a whole; clothes and garments view it as composed
of separate parts. Clothes, clothing, and garments may be used of inner or outer covering; all the other words
in the list (with possible rare exceptions in the case of raiment) refer to the outer garments. Array, raiment,
and vesture are archaic or poetic; so, too, is habit, except in technical use to denote a lady's riding-dress. The
word vestments is now rare, except in ecclesiastical use. Apparel and attire are most frequently used of
somewhat complete and elegant outer clothing, tho Shakespeare speaks of "poor and mean attire." Dress may
be used, specifically, for a woman's gown, and in that sense may be either rich or shabby; but in the general
sense it denotes outer clothing which is meant to be elegant, complete, and appropriate to some social or
public occasion; as, full dress, court dress, evening dress, etc. Dress has now largely displaced apparel and
attire. Garb denotes the clothing characteristic of some class, profession, or the like; as, the garb of a priest.
Costume is chiefly used for that which befits an assumed character; as, a theatrical costume; we sometimes
speak of a national costume, etc.
Antonyms:
bareness, dishabille, exposure, nakedness, nudity, undress. disarray,
* * * * *
DRIVE.
Synonyms:
compel, propel, repel, resist, thrust, impel, push, repulse, ride, urge on.
To drive is to move an object with some force or violence before or away from oneself; it is the direct reverse
of draw, lead, etc. A man leads a horse by the halter, drives him with whip and rein. One may be driven to a
thing or from it; hence, drive is a synonym equally for compel or for repel or repulse. Repulse is stronger and
more conclusive than repel; one may be repelled by the very aspect of the person whose favor he seeks, but is
not repulsed except by the direct refusal or ignoring of his suit. A certain conventional modern usage,
especially in England, requires us to say that we drive in a carriage, ride upon a horse; tho in Scripture we
read of riding in a chariot (2 Kings ix, 16; Jer. xvii, 25, etc.); good examples of the same usage may be found
abundantly in the older English. The propriety of a person's saying that he is going to drive when he is simply
to be conveyed in a carriage, where some one else, as the coachman, does all the driving, is exceedingly
questionable. Many good authorities prefer to use ride in the older and broader sense as signifying to be
supported and borne along by any means of conveyance. Compare BANISH; COMPEL; INFLUENCE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for DRAW.
Prepositions:
Drive to market; to despair; drive into exile; from one's presence; out of the city; drive by, with, or under the
lash; drive by or past beautiful estates; along the beach; beside the river; through the park; across the field;
around the square; to the door; into the barn; out of the sunshine.
* * * * *
DUPLICATE.
Synonyms:
copy, facsimile, likeness, reproduction, counterpart, imitation, replica, transcript.
A copy is as nearly like the original as the copyist has power to make it; a duplicate is exactly like the
original; a carbon copy of a typewritten document must be a duplicate; we may have an inaccurate copy, but
never an inaccurate duplicate. A facsimile is like the original in appearance; a duplicate is the same as the
original in substance and effect; a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence is not a duplicate. A facsimile
of a key might be quite useless; a duplicate will open the lock. A counterpart exactly corresponds to another
object, but perhaps without design, while a copy is intentional. An imitation is always thought of as inferior to
the original; as, an imitation of Milton. A replica is a copy of a work of art by the maker of the original. In
law, a copy of an instrument has in itself no authority; the signatures, as well as other matters, may be copied;
a duplicate is really an original, containing the same provisions and signed by the same persons, so that it may
have in all respects the same force and effect; a transcript is an official copy, authenticated by the signature of
the proper officer, and by the seal of the appropriate court. While strictly there could be but one duplicate, the
word is now extended to an indefinite number of exact copies. Reproduction is chiefly applied to living
organisms.
Antonyms:
archetype, model, original, pattern, prototype.

DUTY.
Synonyms:
accountability, function, office, right, business, obligation, responsibility, righteousness.
Etymologically, duty is that which is owed or due; obligation, that to or by which one is bound; right, that
which is correct, straight, or in the direct line of truth and goodness; responsibility, that for which one must
answer. Duty and responsibility are thought of as to some person or persons; right is impersonal. One's duty
may be to others or to himself; his obligations and responsibilities are to others. Duty arises from the nature of
things; obligation and responsibility may be created by circumstances, as by one's own promise, or by the
acceptance of a trust, etc. We speak of a parent's duty, a debtor's obligation; or of a child's duty of obedience,
and a parent's responsibility for the child's welfare. Right is that which accords with the moral system of the
universe. Righteousness is right incarnated in action. In a more limited sense, right may be used of what one
may rightly claim, and so be the converse of duty. It is the creditor's right to demand payment, and the debtor's
duty to pay. Compare BUSINESS.
* * * * *
EAGER.
Synonyms:
animated, desirous, glowing, importunate, longing, anxious, earnest, hot, intense, vehement, ardent,
enthusiastic, impatient, intent, yearning, burning, fervent, impetuous, keen, zealous.
One is eager who impatiently desires to accomplish some end; one is earnest with a desire that is less
impatient, but more deep, resolute, and constant; one is anxious with a desire that foresees rather the pain of
disappointment than the delight of attainment. One is eager for the gratification of any appetite or passion; he
is earnest in conviction, purpose, or character. Eager usually refers to some specific and immediate
satisfaction, earnest to something permanent and enduring; the patriotic soldier is earnest in his devotion to
his country, eager for a decisive battle.
Antonyms:
apathetic, cool, indifferent, regardless, unconcerned, calm, dispassionate, negligent, stolid, uninterested,
careless, frigid, phlegmatic, stony, unmindful, cold, heedless, purposeless, stupid, unmoved.
Prepositions:
Eager for (more rarely after) favor, honor, etc.; eager in pursuit.
* * * * *
EASE.
Synonyms:
easiness, expertness, facility, knack, readiness.
Ease in the sense here considered denotes freedom from conscious or apparent effort, tax, or strain. Ease may
be either of condition or of action; facility is always of action; readiness is of action or of expected action.
One lives at ease who has no pressing cares; one stands at ease, moves or speaks with ease, when wholly
without constraint. Facility is always active; readiness may be active or passive; the speaker has facility of
expression, readiness of wit; any appliance is in readiness for use. Ease of action may imply merely the
possession of ample power; facility always implies practise and skill; any one can press down the keys of a
typewriter with ease; only the skilled operator works the machine with facility. Readiness in the active sense
includes much of the meaning of ease with the added idea of promptness or alertness. Easiness applies to the
thing done, rather than to the doer. Expertness applies to the more mechanical processes of body and mind; we
speak of the readiness of an orator, but of the expertness of a gymnast. Compare COMFORTABLE;
DEXTERITY; POWER.
Antonyms:
annoyance, difficulty, irritation, trouble, vexation, awkwardness, discomfort, perplexity, uneasiness, worry.
constraint, disquiet,

EDUCATION.
Synonyms:
breeding, discipline, learning, study, cultivation, information, nurture, teaching, culture, instruction, reading,
training, development, knowledge, schooling, tuition.
Education (L. educere, to lead or draw out) is the systematic development and cultivation of the mind and
other natural powers. "Education is the harmonious development of all our faculties. It begins in the nursery,
and goes on at school, but does not end there. It continues through life, whether we will or not.... 'Every
person,' says Gibbon, 'has two educations, one which he receives from others, and one more important, which
he gives himself.'" JOHN LUBBOCK The Use of Life ch. vii, p. 111. [MACM. '94.] Instruction, the
impartation of knowledge by others (L. instruere, to build in or into) is but a part of education, often the
smallest part. Teaching is the more familiar and less formal word for instruction. Training refers not merely to
the impartation of knowledge, but to the exercising of one in actions with the design to form habits. Discipline
is systematic and rigorous training, with the idea of subjection to authority and perhaps of punishment.
Tuition is the technical term for teaching as the business of an instructor or as in the routine of a school;
tuition is narrower than teaching, not, like the latter word, including training. Study is emphatically what one
does for himself. We speak of the teaching, training, or discipline, but not of the education or tuition of a dog
or a horse. Breeding and nurture include teaching and training, especially as directed by and dependent upon
home life and personal association; breeding having reference largely to manners with such qualities as are
deemed distinctively characteristic of high birth; nurture (literally nourishing) having more direct reference to
moral qualities, not overlooking the physical and mental. Knowledge and learning tell nothing of mental
development apart from the capacity to acquire and remember, and nothing whatever of that moral
development which is included in education in its fullest and noblest sense; learning, too, may be acquired by
one's unaided industry, but any full education must be the result in great part of instruction, training, and
personal association. Study is emphatically what one does for himself, and in which instruction and tuition can
only point the way, encourage the student to advance, and remove obstacles; vigorous, persevering study is
one of the best elements of training. Study is also used in the sense of the thing studied, a subject to be
mastered by study, a studious pursuit. Compare KNOWLEDGE; REFINEMENT; WISDOM.
Antonyms:
ignorance, illiteracy.
Compare synonyms for IGNORANT.
* * * * *
EFFRONTERY.
Synonyms:
assurance, boldness, hardihood, insolence, audacity, brass, impudence, shamelessness.
Audacity, in the sense here considered, is a reckless defiance of law, decency, public opinion, or personal
rights, claims, or views, approaching the meaning of impudence or shamelessness, but always carrying the
thought of the personal risk that one disregards in such defiance; the merely impudent or shameless person
may take no thought of consequences; the audacious person recognizes and recklessly braves them.
Hardihood defies and disregards the rational judgment of men. Effrontery (L. effrons, barefaced, shameless)
adds to audacity and hardihood the special element of defiance of considerations of propriety, duty, and
respect for others, yet not to the extent implied in impudence or shamelessness. Impudence disregards what is
due to superiors; shamelessness defies decency. Boldness is forward-stepping courage, spoken of with
reference to the presence and observation of others; boldness, in the good sense, is courage viewed from the
outside; but the word is frequently used in an unfavorable sense to indicate a lack of proper sensitiveness and
modesty. Compare ASSURANCE; BRAVE.
Antonyms:
bashfulness, diffidence, sensitiveness, shyness, coyness, modesty, shrinking, timidity.
* * * * *
EGOTISM.
Synonyms:
conceit, self-assertion, self-confidence, self-esteem, egoism, self-conceit, self-consciousness, vanity.
Egoism is giving the "I" undue supremacy in thought; egotism is giving the "I" undue prominence in speech.
Egotism is sometimes used in the sense of egoism, or supreme regard for oneself. Self-assertion is the claim
by word, act, or manner of what one believes to be his due; self-conceit is an overestimate of one's own
powers or deserts. Conceit is a briefer expression for self-conceit, with always an offensive implication;
self-conceit is ridiculous or pitiable; conceit arouses resentment. There is a worthy self-confidence which
springs from consciousness of rectitude and of power equal to demands. Self-assertion at times becomes a
duty; but self-conceit is always a weakness. Self-consciousness is the keeping of one's thoughts upon oneself,
with the constant anxious question of what others will think. Vanity is an overweening admiration of self,
craving equal admiration from others; self-consciousness is commonly painful to its possessor, vanity always
a source of satisfaction, except as it fails to receive its supposed due. Self-esteem is more solid and better
founded than self-conceit; but is ordinarily a weakness, and never has the worthy sense of self-confidence.
Compare ASSURANCE; PRIDE.
Antonyms:
bashfulness, humility, self-forgetfulness, unobtrusiveness, deference, modesty, shyness, unostentatiousness.
diffidence, self-distrust,
* * * * *
EMBLEM.
Synonyms:
attribute, figure, image, sign, symbol, token, type.
Emblem is the English form of emblema, a Latin word of Greek origin, signifying a figure beaten out on a
metallic vessel by blows from within; also, a figure inlaid in wood, stone, or other material as a copy of some
natural object. The Greek word symbolon denoted a victor's wreath, a check, or any object that might be
compared with, or found to correspond with another, whether there was or was not anything in the objects
compared to suggest the comparison. Thus an emblem resembles, a symbol represents. An emblem has some
natural fitness to suggest that for which it stands; a symbol has been chosen or agreed upon to suggest
something else, with or without natural fitness; a sign does actually suggest the thing with or without reason,
and with or without intention or choice. A symbol may be also an emblem; thus the elements of bread and
wine in the Lord's Supper are both appropriate emblems and his own chosen symbols of suffering and death. A
statement of doctrine is often called a symbol of faith; but it is not an emblem. On the other hand, the same
thing may be both a sign and a symbol; a letter of the alphabet is a sign which indicates a sound; but letters are
often used as mathematical, chemical, or astronomical symbols. A token is something given or done as a
pledge or expression of feeling or intent; while the sign may be unintentional, the token is voluntary; kind
looks may be signs of regard; a gift is a token; a ring, which is a natural emblem of eternity, and also its
accepted symbol, is frequently given as a token of friendship or love. A figure in the sense here considered is
something that represents an idea to the mind somewhat as a form is represented to the eye, as in drawing,
painting, or sculpture; as representing a future reality, a figure may be practically the same as a type. An
image is a visible representation, especially in sculpture, having or supposed to have a close resemblance to
that which it represents. A type is in religion a representation of a greater reality to come; we speak of one
object as the type of the class whose characteristics it exhibits, as in the case of animal or vegetable types. An
attribute in art is some accessory used to characterize a figure or scene; the attribute is often an emblem or
symbol; thus the eagle is the attribute of St. John as an emblem of lofty spiritual vision. Compare SIGN.
* * * * *
EMIGRATE.
Synonyms:
immigrate, migrate.
To migrate is to change one's dwelling-place, usually with the idea of repeated change, or of periodical return;
it applies to wandering tribes of men, and to many birds and animals. Emigrate and immigrate carry the idea
of a permanent change of residence to some other country or some distant region; the two words are used
distinctively of human beings, and apply to the same person and the same act, according to the side from
which the action is viewed.
Prepositions:
A person emigrates from the land he leaves, and immigrates to the land where he takes up his abode.
* * * * *
EMPLOY.
Synonyms:
call, engage, engross, hire, make use of, use, use up.
In general terms it may be said that to employ is to devote to one's purpose, to use is to render subservient to
one's purpose; what is used is viewed as more absolutely an instrument than what is employed; a merchant
employs a clerk; he uses pen and paper; as a rule, use is not said of persons, except in a degrading sense; as,
the conspirators used him as a go-between. Hence the expression common in some religious circles "that God
would use me" is not to be commended; it has also the fault of representing the human worker as absolutely a
passive and helpless instrument; the phrase is altogether unscriptural; the Scripture says, "We are laborers
together with (co-workers with) God." That which is used is often consumed in the using, or in familiar phrase
used up; as, we used twenty tons of coal last winter; in such cases we could not substitute employ. A person
may be employed in his own work or in that of another; in the latter case the service is always understood to
be for pay. In this connection employ is a word of more dignity than hire; a general is employed in his
country's service; a mercenary adventurer is hired to fight a tyrant's battles. It is unsuitable, according to
present usage, to speak of hiring a pastor; the Scripture, indeed, says of the preacher, "The laborer is worthy
of his hire;" but this sense is archaic, and hire now implies that the one hired works directly and primarily for
the pay, as expressed in the noun "hireling;" a Pastor is properly said to be called, or when the business side of
the transaction is referred to, engaged, or possibly employed, at a certain salary.
Prepositions:
Employ in, on, upon, or about a work, business, etc.; for a purpose; at a stipulated salary.
* * * * *
END, v.
Synonyms:
break off, close, conclude, expire, quit, terminate, cease, complete, desist, finish, stop, wind up.
That ends, or is ended, of which there is no more, whether or not more was intended or needed; that is closed,
completed, concluded, or finished which has come to an expected or appropriate end. A speech may be ended
almost as soon as begun, because of the speaker's illness, or of tumult in the audience; in such a case, the
speech is neither closed, completed, nor finished, nor, in the strict sense, concluded. An argument may be
closed with nothing proved; when an argument is concluded all that is deemed necessary to prove the point
has been stated. To finish is to do the last thing there is to do; as, "I have finished my course," 2 Tim. iv, 7.
Finish has come to mean, not merely to complete in the essentials, but to perfect in all the minute details, as in
the expression "to add the finishing touches." The enumeration is completed; the poem, the picture, the statue
is finished. To terminate may be either to bring to an arbitrary or to an appropriate end; as, he terminated his
remarks abruptly; the spire terminates in a cross. A thing stops that comes to rest from motion; or the motion
stops or ceases when the object comes to rest; stop frequently signifies to bring or come to a sudden and
decided cessation of motion, progress, or action of any kind. Compare DO; TRANSACT.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for BEGIN.
* * * * *
END, n.
Synonyms:
accomplishment, effect, limit, achievement, expiration, outcome, bound, extent, period, boundary, extremity,
point, cessation, finale, purpose, close, finis, result, completion, finish, termination, conclusion, fulfilment,
terminus, consequence, goal, tip, consummation, intent, utmost, design, issue, uttermost.
The end is the terminal part of a material object that has length; the extremity is distinctively the terminal
point, and may thus be but part of the end in the general sense of that word; the extremity is viewed as that
which is most remote from some center, or some mean or standard position; the southern end of South
America includes all Patagonia, the southern extremity or point is Cape Horn. Tip has nearly the same
meaning as extremity, but is said of small or slight and tapering objects; as, the tip of the finger; point in such
connections is said of that which is drawn out to exceeding fineness or sharpness, as the point of a needle, a
fork, or a sword; extremity is said of something considerable; we do not speak of the extremity of a needle.
Terminus is chiefly used to designate the end of a line of travel or transportation: specifically, the furthermost
station in any direction on a railway, or by extension the town or village where it is situated. Termination is
the Latin and more formal word for the Saxon end, but is chiefly used of time, words, undertakings, or
abstractions of any kind. Expiration signifies the coming to an end in the natural course of things; as, the
expiration of a year, or of a lease; it is used of things of some consequence; we do not ordinarily speak of the
expiration of an hour or of a day. Limit implies some check to or restraint upon further advance, right, or
privilege; as, the limits of an estate (compare BOUNDARY). A goal is an end sought or striven for, as in a
race. For the figurative senses of end and its associated words, compare the synonyms for the verb END; also
for AIM; CONSEQUENCE; DESIGN.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for BEGINNING.
* * * * *
ENDEAVOR, v.
Synonyms:
attempt, essay, strive, try, undertake.
To attempt is to take action somewhat experimentally with the hope and purpose of accomplishing a certain
result; to endeavor is to attempt strenuously and with firm and enduring purpose. To attempt expresses a
single act; to endeavor, a continuous exertion; we say I will endeavor (not I will attempt) while I live. To
attempt is with the view of accomplishing; to essay, with a view of testing our own powers. To undertake is to
accept or take upon oneself as an obligation, as some business, labor, or trust; the word often implies complete
assurance of success; as, I will undertake to produce the witness. To strive suggests little of the result, much
of toil, strain, and contest, in seeking it; I will strive to fulfil your wishes, i. e., I will spare no labor and
exertion to do it. Try is the most comprehensive of these words. The original idea of testing or experimenting
is not thought of when a man says "I will try." To attempt suggests giving up, if the thing is not accomplished
at a stroke; to try implies using other means and studying out other ways if not at first successful. Endeavor is
more mild and formal; the pilot in the burning pilot-house does not say "I will endeavor" or "I will attempt to
hold the ship to her course," but "I'll try, sir!"
Antonyms:
abandon, give up, omit, throw away, dismiss, let go, overlook, throw over, drop, neglect, pass by, throw up.
* * * * *
ENDEAVOR, n.
Synonyms:
attempt, effort, essay, exertion, struggle, trial.
Effort denotes the voluntary putting forth of power to attain or accomplish some specific thing; it reaches
toward a definite end; exertion is a putting forth of power without special reference to an object. Every effort
is an exertion, but not every exertion is an effort. Attempt is more experimental than effort, endeavor less
strenuous but more continuous. An effort is a single act, an endeavor a continued series of acts; an endeavor is
sustained and enduring, and may be lifelong; we do not have a society of Christian Attempt, or of Christian
Effort, but of Christian Endeavor. A struggle is a violent effort or strenuous exertion. An essay is an attempt,
effort, or endeavor made as a test of the powers of the one who makes it. Compare ENDEAVOR, v.
* * * * *
ENDURE.
Synonyms:
abide, bear, brook, submit to, sustain, afford, bear up under, permit, suffer, tolerate, allow, bear with, put up
with, support, undergo.
Bear is the most general of these words; it is metaphorically to hold up or keep up a burden of care, pain,
grief, annoyance, or the like, without sinking, lamenting, or repining. Allow and permit involve large
concession of the will; put up with and tolerate imply decided aversion and reluctant withholding of
opposition or interference; whispering is allowed by the school-teacher who does not forbid nor censure it;
one puts up with the presence of a disagreeable visitor; a state tolerates a religion which it would be glad to
suppress. To endure is to bear with strain and resistance, but with conscious power; endure conveys a fuller
suggestion of contest and conquest than bear. One may choose to endure the pain of a surgical operation
rather than take anesthetics; he permits the thing to come which he must brace himself to endure when it
comes. To afford is to be equal to a pecuniary demand, i. e., to be able to bear it. To brook is quietly to put up
with provocation or insult. Abide combines the senses of await and endure; as, I will abide the result.
Compare ABIDE; SUPPORT.
Antonyms:
break, despair, fail, fall, give out, sink, surrender, break down, droop, faint, falter, give up, succumb, yield.
* * * * *
ENEMY.
Synonyms:
adversary, antagonist, competitor, foe, opponent, rival.
An enemy in private life is one who is moved by hostile feeling with active disposition to injure; but in
military language all who fight on the opposite side are called enemies or collectively "the enemy," where no
personal animosity may be implied; foe, which is rather a poetical and literary word, implies intensely hostile
spirit and purpose. An antagonist is one who opposes and is opposed actively and with intensity of effort; an
opponent, one in whom the attitude of resistance is the more prominent; a competitor, one who seeks the same
object for which another is striving; antagonists in wrestling, competitors in business, opponents in debate
may contend with no personal ill will; rivals in love, ambition, etc., rarely avoid inimical feeling. Adversary
was formerly much used in the general sense of antagonist or opponent, but is now less common, and largely
restricted to the hostile sense; an adversary is ordinarily one who not only opposes another in fact, but does so
with hostile spirit, or perhaps out of pure malignity; as, the great Adversary. Compare synonyms for
AMBITION.
Antonyms:
abettor, accessory, accomplice, ally, friend, helper, supporter.
Prepositions:
He was the enemy of my friend in the contest.
* * * * *
ENMITY.
Synonyms:
acrimony, bitterness, ill will, malignity, animosity, hatred, malevolence, rancor, antagonism, hostility, malice,
spite.
Enmity is the state of being an enemy or the feeling and disposition characterizing an enemy (compare
ENEMY). Animosity denotes a feeling more active and vehement, but often less enduring and determined,
than enmity. Enmity distinctly recognizes its object as an enemy, to be met or dealt with accordingly. Hostility
is enmity in action; the term hostilities between nations denotes actual armed collision. Bitterness is a resentful
feeling arising from a belief that one has been wronged; acrimony is a kindred feeling, but deeper and more
persistent, and may arise from the crossing of one's wishes or plans by another, where no injustice or wrong is
felt. Antagonism, as between two competing authors or merchants, does not necessarily imply enmity, but
ordinarily suggests a shade, at least, of hostile feeling. Malice is a disposition or intent to injure others, for the
gratification of some evil passion; malignity is intense and violent enmity, hatred, or malice. Compare
synonyms for ACRIMONY; ANGER; HATRED.
Antonyms:
agreement, amity, friendship, kindliness, regard, alliance, concord, harmony, kindness, sympathy.
* * * * *
ENTERTAIN.
Synonyms:
amuse, cheer, disport, enliven, interest, please, beguile, delight, divert, gratify, occupy, recreate.
To entertain, in the sense here considered, is to engage and pleasantly occupy the attention; to amuse is to
occupy the attention in an especially bright and cheerful way, often with that which excites merriment or
laughter; as, he entertained us with an amusing story. To divert is to turn from serious thoughts or laborious
pursuits to something that lightly and agreeably occupies the mind; one may be entertained or amused who
has nothing serious or laborious from which to be diverted. To recreate, literally to re-create, is to engage
mind or body in some pleasing activity that restores strength and energy for serious work. To beguile is, as it
were, to cheat into cheer and comfort by something that insensibly draws thought or feeling away from pain
or disquiet. We beguile a weary hour, cheer the despondent, divert the preoccupied, enliven a dull evening or
company, gratify our friends' wishes, entertain, interest, please a listening audience, occupy idle time, disport
ourselves when merry, recreate when worn with toil; we amuse ourselves or others with whatever pleasantly
passes the time without special exertion, each according to his taste.
Antonyms:
annoy, bore, busy, disquiet, distract, disturb, tire, weary.
* * * * *
ENTERTAINMENT.
Synonyms:
amusement, diversion, fun, pleasure, cheer, enjoyment, merriment, recreation, delight, frolic, pastime, sport.
Entertainment and recreation imply thought and mental occupation, tho in an agreeable, refreshing way; they
are therefore words of a high order. Entertainment, apart from its special senses of a public performance or a
social party, and predominantly even there, is used of somewhat mirthful mental delight; recreation may, and
usually does, combine the mental with the physical. Amusement and pastime are nearly equivalent, the latter
probably the lighter word; many slight things may be pastimes which we should hardly dignify by the name of
amusements. Sports are almost wholly on the physical plane, tho involving a certain grade of mental action;
fox-hunting, horse-racing, and baseball are sports. Certain sports may afford entertainment or recreation to
certain persons, according to their individual tastes; but entertainment and recreation are capable of a
meaning so high as never to be approached by any meaning of sport. Cheer may be very quiet, as the cheer of
a bright fire to an aged traveler; merriment is with liveliness and laughter; fun and frolic are apt to be
boisterous. Amusement is a form of enjoyment, but enjoyment may be too keen to be called amusement.
Compare synonyms for ENTERTAIN.
Antonyms:
ennui, fatigue, labor, lassitude, toil, weariness, work.

ENTHUSIASM.
Synonyms:
ardor, excitement, frenzy, transport, devotion, extravagance, inspiration, vehemence, eagerness, fanaticism,
intensity, warmth, earnestness, fervency, passion, zeal. ecstasy, fervor, rapture,
The old meaning of enthusiasm implies a pseudo-inspiration, an almost frantic extravagance in behalf of
something supposed to be an expression of the divine will. This sense remains as the controlling one in the
kindred noun enthusiast. Enthusiasm has now chiefly the meaning of an earnest and commendable devotion,
an intense and eager interest. Against the hindrances of the world, nothing great and good can be carried
without a certain fervor, intensity, and vehemence; these joined with faith, courage, and hopefulness make
enthusiasm. Zeal is burning earnestness, always tending to vigorous action with all the devotion of
enthusiasm, tho often without its hopefulness. Compare EAGER.
Antonyms:
calculation, caution, deadness, indifference, policy, timidity, calmness, coldness, dulness, lukewarmness,
prudence, wariness.
* * * * *
ENTRANCE.
Synonyms:
access, approach, gate, introduction, accession, door, gateway, opening, adit, doorway, ingress, penetration,
admission, entre, inlet, portal. admittance, entry,
Entrance, the act of entering, refers merely to the fact of passing from without to within some enclosure;
admission and admittance refer to entering by or with some one's consent, or at least to opportunity afforded
by some one's act or neglect. We may effect or force an entrance, but not admittance or admission; those we
gain, procure, obtain, secure, win. Admittance refers to place, admission refers also to position, privilege,
favor, friendship, etc. An intruder may gain admittance to the hall of a society who would not be allowed
admission to its membership. Approach is a movement toward another; access is coming all the way to his
presence, recognition, and consideration. An unworthy favorite may prevent even those who gain admittance
to a king's audience from obtaining any real access to the king. Entrance is also used figuratively for setting
out upon some career, or becoming a member of some organization; as, we speak of one's entrance upon
college life, or of entrance into the ministry.
Antonyms:
departure, ejection, exit, refusal, withdrawal. egress, exclusion, expulsion, rejection,
Prepositions:
Entrance into a place; on or upon a work or course of action; into or upon office; into battle; by or through the
door; within the gates; into or among the company.
* * * * *
ENVIOUS.
Synonyms:
jealous, suspicious.
One is envious who cherishes selfish ill will toward another because of his superior success, endowments,
possessions, or the like. A person is envious of that which is another's, and to which he himself has no right or
claim; he is jealous of intrusion upon that which is his own, or to which he maintains a right or claim. An
envious spirit is always bad; a jealous spirit may be good or bad, according to its object and tendency. A free
people must be jealous of their liberties if they would retain them. One is suspicious of another from
unfavorable indications or from a knowledge of wrong in his previous conduct, or even without reason.
Compare DOUBT.
Antonyms:
contented, friendly, kindly, satisfied, trustful, well-disposed.
Prepositions:
Envious of (formerly at or against) a person; envious of his wealth or power; envious of him for, because of,
on account of his wealth or power.
* * * * *
EQUIVOCAL.
Synonyms:
ambiguous, enigmatical, indistinct, questionable, doubtful, indefinite, obscure, suspicious, dubious,
indeterminate, perplexing, uncertain. enigmatic,
Equivocal (L. equus, equal, and vox, voice, word) denotes that which may equally well be understood in either
of two or more ways. Ambiguous (L. ambi, around, and ago, drive, lead) signifies lacking in distinctness or
certainty, obscure or doubtful through indefiniteness of expression. Ambiguous is applied only to spoken or
written statements; equivocal has other applications. A statement is ambiguous when it leaves the mind of the
reader or hearer to fluctuate between two meanings, which would fit the language equally well; it is equivocal
when it would naturally be understood in one way, but is capable of a different interpretation; an equivocal
expression is, as a rule, intentionally deceptive, while an ambiguous utterance may be simply the result of a
want either of clear thought or of adequate expression. That which is enigmatical must be guessed like a
riddle; a statement may be purposely made enigmatical in order to provoke thought and study. That is
doubtful which is fairly open to doubt; that is dubious which has become the subject of doubts so grave as
scarcely to fall short of condemnation; as, a dubious reputation. Questionable may be used nearly in the sense
either of dubious or of doubtful; a questionable statement is one that must be proved before it can be accepted.
To say that one's honesty is questionable is a mild way of saying that in the opinion of the speaker he is likely
to prove dishonest. Equivocal is sometimes, tho more rarely, used in this sense. A suspicious character gives
manifest reason to be suspected; a suspicious temper is inclined to suspect the motives and intentions of
others, with or without reason. Compare CLEAR.
Antonyms:
certain, evident, lucid, perspicuous, unequivocal, clear, indisputable, manifest, plain, unquestionable, distinct,
indubitable, obvious, unambiguous, unquestioned.
* * * * *
ESTEEM, v.
Synonyms:
appreciate, consider, estimate, prize, think, calculate, deem, hold, regard, value.
Esteem and estimate alike imply to set a certain mental value upon, but esteem is less precise and mercantile
than calculate or estimate. We esteem a jewel precious; we estimate it to be worth so much money. This sense
of esteem is now chiefly found in literary or oratorical style, and in certain conventional phrases; as, I esteem
it an honor, a favor. In popular usage esteem, as said of persons, denotes a union of respect and kindly feeling
and, in the highest sense, of moral approbation; as, one whom I highly esteem; the word may be used in a
similar sense of material things or abstractions; as, one whose friendship I esteem; a shell greatly esteemed for
inlaid work. To appreciate anything is to be deeply or keenly sensible of or sensitive to its qualities or
influence, to see its full import, be alive to its value, importance, or worth; as, to appreciate beauty or
harmony; to appreciate one's services in a cause; the word is similarly, tho rarely, used of persons. To prize is
to set a high value on for something more than merely commercial reasons. One may value some object, as a
picture, beyond all price, as a family heirloom, or may prize it as the gift of an esteemed friend, without at all
appreciating its artistic merit or commercial value. To regard (F. regarder, look at, observe) is to have a
certain mental view favorable or unfavorable; as, I regard him as a friend; or, I regard him as a villain; regard
has a distinctively favorable sense as applied to institutions, proprieties, duties, etc., but does not share the use
of the noun regard as applied to persons; we regard the Sabbath; we regard a person's feelings; we have a
regard for the person. Compare ESTEEM, n.
* * * * *
ESTEEM, n.
Synonyms:
estimate, estimation, favor, regard, respect.
Esteem for a person is a favorable opinion on the basis of worth, especially of moral worth, joined with a
feeling of interest in and attraction toward the person. Regard for a person is the mental view or feeling that
springs from a sense of his value, excellence, or superiority, with a cordial and hearty friendliness. Regard is
more personal and less distant than esteem, and adds a special kindliness; respect is a more distant word than
esteem. Respect may be wholly on one side, while regard is more often mutual; respect in the fullest sense is
given to what is lofty, worthy, and honorable, or to a person of such qualities; we may pay an external respect
to one of lofty station, regardless of personal qualities, showing respect for the office. Estimate has more of
calculation; as, my estimate of the man, or of his abilities, is very high. Estimation involves the idea of
calculation or appraisal with that of esteem or regard, and is especially used of the feeling entertained by
numbers of people; as, he stood high in public estimation. Compare ESTEEM, v.; FRIENDSHIP; LOVE.
Antonyms:
abhorrence, aversion, dislike, loathing, antipathy, contempt, hatred, repugnance.

ETERNAL.
Synonyms:
deathless, fadeless, never-failing, undying, endless, immortal, perennial, unending, eonian, imperishable,
perpetual, unfading, everlasting, interminable, timeless, unfailing, ever-living, never-ending, unceasing,
without end.
Eternal strictly signifies without beginning or end, in which sense it applies to God alone; everlasting applies
to that which may or may not have beginning, but will never cease; eternal is also used in this more limited
sense; endless, without end, in its utmost reach, is not distinguishable from everlasting; but endless is
constantly used in inferior senses, especially in mechanics, as in the phrases an endless screw, an endless
chain. Everlasting and endless are both used in a limited sense of protracted, indefinite, but not infinite
duration; as, the everlasting hills; endless debates; so we speak of interminable quarrels. Eternal holds quite
strictly to the vast and sacred meaning in which it is applied to the Divine Being and the future state.
Everlasting, endless, and eternal may be applied to that which has no life; as, everlasting chains, endless
night, eternal death; immortal applies to that which now has life, and is forever exempt from death. Timeless
carries, perhaps, the fullest idea of eternal, as above and beyond time, and not to be measured by it.
* * * * *
EVENT.
Synonyms:
case, contingency, fortune, outcome, chance, end, incident, possibility, circumstance, episode, issue, result,
consequence, fact, occurrence, sequel.
Etymologically, the incident is that which falls in, the event that which comes out; event is thus greater and
more signal than incident; we speak of trifling incidents, great events; incidents of daily life, events of history.
Circumstance agrees with incident in denoting a matter of relatively slight importance, but implies a more
direct connection with the principal matter; "circumstantial evidence" is evidence from seemingly minor
matters directly connected with a case; "incidental evidence" would be some evidence that happened
unexpectedly to touch it. An occurrence is, etymologically, that which we run against, without thought of its
origin, connection or tendency. An episode is connected with the main course of events, like an incident or
circumstance, but is of more independent interest and importance. Outcome is the Saxon, and event the Latin
for expressing the same original idea. Consequence or result would express more of logical connection, and
be more comprehensive. The end may be simple cessation; the event is what has been accomplished; the event
of a war is victory or defeat; the end of the war is reached when a treaty of peace is signed. Since the future is
contingent, event comes to have the meaning of a contingency; as, in the event of his death, the policy will at
once fall due. Compare CIRCUMSTANCE; CONSEQUENCE; END.
* * * * *
EVERY.
Synonyms:
all, any, both, each, either.
All and both are collective; any, each, and every are distributive. Any makes no selection and may not reach to
the full limits of all; each and every make no exception or omission, and must extend to all; all sweeps in the
units as part of a total, each and every proceed through the units to the total. A promise made to all omits
none; a promise made to any may not reach all; a promise made to every one is so made that no individual
shall fail to be aware of it; a promise made to each is made to the individuals personally, one by one. Each is
thus more individual and specific than every; every classifies, each individualizes. Each divides, both unites;
if a certain sum is given to each of two persons, both (together) must receive twice the amount; both must be
aware of what has been separately communicated to each; a man may fire both barrels of a gun by a single
movement; if he fires each barrel, he discharges them separately. Either properly denotes one of two,
indefinitely, to the exclusion of the other. The use of either in the sense of each or both, tho sustained by good
authority, is objectionable because ambiguous. His friends sat on either side of the room would naturally
mean on one side or the other; if the meaning is on both sides, it would be better to say so.
* * * * *
EVIDENT.
Synonyms:
apparent, glaring, overt, tangible, clear, indubitable, palpable, transparent, conspicuous, manifest, patent,
unmistakable, discernible, obvious, perceptible, visible. distinct, open, plain,
That is apparent which clearly appears to the senses or to the mind as soon as the attention is directed toward
it; that is evident of which the mind is made sure by some inference that supplements the facts of perception;
the marks of a struggle were apparent in broken shrubbery and trampled ground, and the finding of a
mutilated body and a rifled purse made it evident that robbery and murder had been committed. That is
manifest which we can lay the hand upon; manifest is thus stronger than evident, as touch is more absolute
than sight; that the picture was a modern copy of an ancient work was evident, and on comparison with the
original its inferiority was manifest. That is obvious which is directly in the way so that it can not be missed;
as, the application of the remark was obvious. Visible applies to all that can be perceived by the sense of sight,
whether the noonday sun, a ship on the horizon, or a microscopic object. Discernible applies to that which is
dimly or faintly visible, requiring strain and effort in order to be seen; as, the ship was discernible through the
mist. That is conspicuous which stands out so as necessarily or strikingly to attract the attention. Palpable and
tangible express more emphatically the thought of manifest.
Antonyms:
concealed, impalpable, latent, secret, unknown, covert, impenetrable, obscure, undiscovered, unseen, dark,
imperceptible, occult, unimagined, unthought-of. hidden, invisible,
* * * * *
EXAMPLE.
Synonyms:
archetype, ideal, prototype, type, ensample, model, sample, warning. exemplar, pattern, specimen,
exemplification, precedent, standard,
From its original sense of sample or specimen (L. exemplum) example derives the seemingly contradictory
meanings, on the one hand of a pattern or model, and on the other hand of a warning--a sample or specimen of
what is to be followed, or of what is to be shunned. An example, however, may be more than a sample or
specimen of any class; it may be the very archetype or prototype to which the whole class must conform, as
when Christ is spoken of as being an example or leaving an example for his disciples. Example comes nearer
to the possible freedom of the model than to the necessary exactness of the pattern; often we can not, in a
given case, exactly imitate the best example, but only adapt its teachings to altered circumstances. In its
application to a person or thing, exemplar can scarcely be distinguished from example; but example is most
frequently used for an act, or course of action, for which exemplar is not used; as, one sets a good (or a bad)
example. An exemplification is an illustrative working out in action of a principle or law, without any
reference to its being copied or repeated; an example guides, an exemplification illustrates or explains.
Ensample is the same as example, but is practically obsolete outside of Scriptural or theological language.
Compare MODEL; SAMPLE.
* * * * *
EXCESS.
Synonyms:
dissipation, lavishness, redundance, surplus, exorbitance, overplus, redundancy, waste, extravagance,
prodigality, superabundance, wastefulness. intemperance, profusion, superfluity,
Excess is more than enough of anything, and, since this in very many cases indicates a lack either of judgment
or of self-control, the word is used frequently in an unfavorable sense. Careless expenditure in excess of
income is extravagance; we may have also extravagance of language, professions, etc. As extravagance is
excess in outlay, exorbitance is excess in demands, and especially in pecuniary demands upon others.
Overplus and superabundance denote in the main a satisfactory, and superfluity an undesirable, excess;
lavishness and profusion, a generous, bountiful, or amiable excess; as, a profusion of fair hair; lavishness of
hospitality. Surplus is neutral, having none of the unfavorable meaning that often attaches to excess; a surplus
is that which remains over after all demands are met. Redundance or redundancy refers chiefly to literary
style, denoting an excess of words or matter. Excess in the moral sense is expressed by dissipation,
prodigality, intemperance, etc.
Antonyms:
dearth, destitution, frugality, lack, scantiness, defect, economy, inadequacy, need, shortcoming, deficiency,
failure, insufficiency, poverty, want.
* * * * *
EXECUTE.
Synonyms:
administer, carry out, do, enforce, perform.
To execute is to follow through to the end, put into absolute and final effect in action; to administer is to
conduct as one holding a trust, as a minister and not an originator; the sheriff executes a writ; the trustee
administers an estate, a charity, etc.; to enforce is to put into effect by force, actual or potential. To administer
the laws is the province of a court of justice; to execute the laws is the province of a sheriff, marshal,
constable, or other executive officer; to administer the law is to declare or apply it; to execute the law is to put
it in force; for this enforce is the more general word, execute the more specific. From signifying to superintend
officially some application or infliction, administer passes by a natural transition to signify inflict, mete out,
dispense, and blows, medicine, etc., are said to be administered: a usage thoroughly established and reputable
in spite of pedantic objections. Enforce signifies also to present and urge home by intellectual and moral
force; as, to enforce a precept or a duty. Compare DO; KILL; MAKE.
* * * * *
EXERCISE.
Synonyms:
act, application, exertion, performance, action, drill, occupation, practise, activity, employment, operation,
use.
Exercise, in the ordinary sense, is the easy natural action of any power; exertion is the putting of any power to
strain and tax. An exercise-drive for a horse is so much as will develop strength and health and not
appreciably weary. But by qualifying adjectives we may bring exercise up to the full sense of exertion; as,
violent exercise. Exercise is action taken at any time with a view to employing, maintaining, or increasing
power, or merely for enjoyment; practise is systematic exercise with a view to the acquirement of facility and
skill in some pursuit; a person takes a walk for exercise, or takes time for practise on the piano. Practise is
also used of putting into action and effect what one has learned or holds as a theory; as, the practise of law or
medicine; a profession of religion is good, but the practise of it is better. Drill is systematic, rigorous, and
commonly enforced practise under a teacher or commander. Compare HABIT.
Antonyms:
idleness, inaction, inactivity, relaxation, rest.
* * * * *
EXPENSE.
Synonyms:
cost, expenditure, outgo, outlay.
The cost of a thing is whatever one surrenders or gives up for it, intentionally or unintentionally, or even
unconsciously; expense is what is laid out by calculation or intention. We say, "he won his fame at the cost of
his life;" "I know it to my cost;" we speak of a joke at another's expense; at another's cost would seem to make
it a more serious matter. There is a tendency to use cost of what we pay for a possession, expense of what we
pay for a service; we speak of the cost of goods, the expense of making up. Outlay is used of some definite
expenditure, as for the purchase of supplies; outgo of a steady drain or of incidental expenses. See PRICE.
Antonyms:
gain, proceeds, profit, receipt, return, income, product, profits, receipts, returns.
* * * * *
EXPLICIT.
Synonym:
express.
Both explicit and express are opposed to what is merely implicit or implied. That which is explicit is unfolded,
so that it may not be obscure, doubtful, or ambiguous; that which is express is uttered or stated so decidedly
that it may not be forgotten nor overlooked. An explicit statement is too clear to be misunderstood; an express
command is too emphatic to be disregarded. Compare CLEAR.
Antonyms:
ambiguous, implicit, indefinite, uncertain, doubtful, implied, indeterminate, vague.
* * * * *
EXTEMPORANEOUS.
Synonyms:
extemporary, impromptu, offhand, extempore, improvised, unpremeditated.
Extemporaneous, originally signifying of or from the time or occasion, has come to mean done or made with
but little (if any) preparation, and is now chiefly applied to addresses of which the thought has been prepared,
and only the language and incidental treatment left to the suggestion of the moment, so that an
extemporaneous speech is understood to be any one that is not read or recited; impromptu keeps its original
sense, denoting something that springs from the instant; the impromptu utterance is generally brief, direct, and
vigorous; the extemporaneous speech may chance to be prosy. Offhand is still more emphatic as to the
readiness and freedom of the utterance. Unpremeditated is graver and more formal, denoting absolute want of
preparation, but is rather too heavy a word to be applied to such apt, ready utterance as is generally designated
by impromptu.
Antonyms:
elaborated, premeditated, prepared, read, recited, studied, written.
* * * * *
EXTERMINATE.
Synonyms:
annihilate, eradicate, overthrow, uproot, banish, expel, remove, wipe out. destroy, extirpate, root out,
Exterminate (L. ex, out, and terminus, a boundary) signified primarily to drive beyond the bounds or limits of
a country; the word is applied to races of men or animals, and is now almost exclusively used for removal by
death; individuals are now said to be banished or expelled. Eradicate (L. e, out, and radix, root) is primarily
applied to numbers or groups of plants which it is desired to remove effectually from the soil; a single tree
may be uprooted, but is not said to be eradicated; we labor to eradicate or root out noxious weeds. To
extirpate (L. ex, out, and stirps, stem, stock) is not only to destroy the individuals of any race of plants or
animals, but the very stock, so that the race can never be restored; we speak of eradicating a disease, of
extirpating a cancer, exterminating wild beasts or hostile tribes; we seek to eradicate or extirpate all vices and
evils. Compare ABOLISH.
Antonyms:
augment, build up, develop, increase, populate, replenish, beget, cherish, foster, plant, propagate, settle. breed,
colonize,
* * * * *
FAINT.
Synonyms:
dim, fatigued, irresolute, weak, exhausted, feeble, languid, wearied, faded, half-hearted, listless, worn,
faint-hearted, ill-defined, purposeless, worn down, faltering, indistinct, timid, worn out.
Faint, with the general sense of lacking strength or effectiveness, covers a wide range of meaning, signifying
overcome with physical weakness or exhaustion, or lacking in purpose, courage, or energy, as said of persons;
or lacking definiteness or distinctness of color or sound, as said of written characters, voices, or musical notes.
A person may be faint when physically wearied, or when overcome with fear; he may be a faint adherent
because naturally feeble or purposeless, or because half-hearted in the cause; he may be a faltering supporter
because naturally irresolute or because faint-hearted and timid in view of perils that threaten, a listless
worker, through want of mental energy and purpose. Written characters may be faint or dim, either because
originally written with poor ink, or because they have become faded by time and exposure.
Antonyms:
bright, clear, daring, fresh, resolute, sturdy, brilliant, conspicuous, energetic, hearty, strong, vigorous.
Prepositions:
Faint with hunger; faint in color.
* * * * *
FAITH.
Synonyms:
assent, confidence, credit, opinion, assurance, conviction, creed, reliance, belief, credence, doctrine, trust.
Belief, as an intellectual process, is the acceptance of some thing as true on other grounds than personal
observation and experience. We give credence to a report, assent to a proposition or to a proposal. Belief is
stronger than credence; credence might be described as a prima facie belief; credence is a more formal word
than belief, and seems to imply somewhat more of volition; we speak of giving credence to a report, but not of
giving belief. Goods are sold on credit; we give one credit for good intentions. Conviction is a belief
established by argument or evidence; assurance is belief beyond the reach of argument; as, the Christian's
assurance of salvation. An opinion is a general conclusion held as probable, tho without full certainty; a
persuasion is a more confident opinion, involving the heart as well as the intellect. In religion, a doctrine is a
statement of belief regarding a single point; a creed is a summary statement of doctrines. Confidence is a firm
dependence upon a statement as true, or upon a person as worthy. Reliance is confidence on which we act or
are ready to act unquestioningly; we have a calm reliance upon the uniformity of nature. Trust is a practical
and tranquil resting of the mind upon the integrity, kindness, friendship, or promises of a person; we have
trust in God. Faith is a union of belief and trust. Faith is chiefly personal; belief may be quite impersonal; we
speak of belief of a proposition, faith in a promise, because the promise emanates from a person. But belief in
a person is often used with no appreciable difference from faith. In religion it is common to distinguish
between intellectual belief of religious truth, as any other truth might be believed, and belief of the heart, or
saving faith.
Antonyms:
denial, dissent, doubt, infidelity, rejection, suspicion, disbelief, distrust, incredulity, misgiving, skepticism,
unbelief.
Prepositions:
Have faith in God; the faith of the gospel.
* * * * *
FAITHFUL.
Synonyms:
devoted, incorruptible, stanch, true, trusty, firm, loyal, sure, trustworthy, unwavering.
A person is faithful who will keep faith, whether with or without power to aid or serve; a person or thing is
trusty that possesses such qualities as to justify the fullest confidence and dependence. We may speak of a
faithful but feeble friend; we say a trusty agent, a trusty steed, a trusty sword.
Antonyms:
capricious, false, unfaithful, untrustworthy, faithless, fickle, untrue, wavering.
Prepositions:
Faithful in service; to duty; to comrade or commander; faithful among the faithless.
* * * * *
FAME.
Synonyms:
celebrity, eminence, honor, notoriety, reputation, credit, glory, laurels, renown, repute. distinction,
Fame is the widely disseminated report of a person's character, deeds, or abilities, and is oftenest used in the
favorable sense. Reputation and repute are more limited than fame, and may be either good or bad. Notoriety
is evil repute or a dishonorable counterfeit of fame. Eminence and distinction may result from rank, station, or
character. Celebrity is limited in range; we speak of local celebrity, or world-wide fame. Fame in its best
sense may be defined as the applause of numbers; renown, as such applause worthily won; we speak of the
conqueror's fame, the patriot's renown. Glory and honor are of good import; honor may be given for qualities
or acts that should not win it, but it is always given as something good and worthy; we can speak of an evil
fame, but not of evil honor; glory has a more exalted and often a sacred sense.
Antonyms:
contempt, discredit, dishonor, humiliation, infamy, obscurity, contumely, disgrace, disrepute, ignominy,
oblivion, shame.
* * * * *
FANATICISM.
Synonyms:
bigotry, credulity, intolerance, superstition.
Fanaticism is extravagant or even frenzied zeal; bigotry is obstinate and unreasoning attachment to a cause or
creed; fanaticism and bigotry usually include intolerance, which is unwillingness to tolerate beliefs or
opinions contrary to one's own; superstition is ignorant and irrational religious belief. Credulity is not
distinctively religious, but is a general readiness to believe without sufficient evidence, with a proneness to
accept the marvellous. Bigotry is narrow, fanaticism is fierce, superstition is ignorant, credulity is weak,
intolerance is severe. Bigotry has not the capacity to reason fairly, fanaticism has not the patience,
superstition has not the knowledge and mental discipline, intolerance has not the disposition. Bigotry,
fanaticism, and superstition are perversions of the religious sentiment; credulity and intolerance often
accompany skepticism or atheism.
Antonyms:
cynicism, free-thinking, indifference, latitudinarianism.
* * * * *
FANCIFUL.
Synonyms:
chimerical, fantastic, grotesque, imaginative, visionary.
That is fanciful which is dictated or suggested by fancy independently of more serious considerations; the
fantastic is the fanciful with the added elements of whimsicalness and extravagance. The fanciful swings away
from the real or the ordinary lightly and pleasantly, the fantastic extravagantly, the grotesque ridiculously. A
fanciful arrangement of objects is commonly pleasing, a fantastic arrangement is striking, a grotesque
arrangement is laughable. A fanciful theory or suggestion may be clearly recognized as such; a visionary
scheme is erroneously supposed to have a basis in fact. Compare synonyms for DREAM; IDEA;
IMAGINATION.
Antonyms:
accurate, commonplace, prosaic, regular, sound, calculable, literal, real, sensible, sure, calculated, ordinary,
reasonable, solid, true.
* * * * *
FANCY.
Synonyms:
belief, desire, imagination, predilection, caprice, humor, inclination, supposition, conceit, idea, liking, vagary,
conception, image, mood, whim.
An intellectual fancy is a mental image or picture founded upon slight or whimsical association or
resemblance; a conceit has less of the picturesque and more of the theoretic than a fancy; a conceit is
somewhat aside from the common laws of reasoning, as a fancy is lighter and more airy than the common
mode of thought. A conceit or fancy may be wholly unfounded, while a conception always has, or is believed
to have, some answering reality. (Compare REASON.) An intellectual fancy or conceit may be pleasing or
amusing, but is never worth serious discussion; we speak of a mere fancy, a droll or odd conceit. An
emotional or personal fancy is a capricious liking formed with slight reason and no exercise of judgment, and
liable to fade as lightly as it was formed. In a broader sense, the fancy signifies the faculty by which fancies or
mental images are formed, associated, or combined. Compare synonyms for DREAM; IDEA;
IMAGINATION.
Antonyms:
actuality, certainty, fact, reality, truth, verity.
Prepositions:
To have a fancy for or take a fancy to a person or thing.
* * * * *
FAREWELL.
Synonyms:
adieu, good-by, parting salutation, valedictory. cong, leave-taking, valediction,
Good-by is the homely and hearty, farewell the formal English word at parting. Adieu, from the French, is still
more ceremonious than farewell; cong, also from the French, is commonly contemptuous or supercilious,
and equivalent to dismissal. Valediction is a learned word never in popular use. A valedictory is a public
farewell to a company or assembly.
Prepositions:
I bade farewell to my comrades, or (without preposition) I bade my comrades farewell; I took a sad farewell of
my friends.
* * * * *
FEAR.
Synonyms:
affright, dismay, horror, timidity, apprehension, disquietude, misgiving, trembling, awe, dread, panic, tremor,
consternation, fright, terror, trepidation.
Fear is the generic term denoting an emotion excited by threatening evil with a desire to avoid or escape it;
fear may be sudden or lingering, in view of present, of imminent, or of distant and only possible danger; in the
latter sense dread is oftener used. Horror (etymologically a shivering or shuddering) denotes a shuddering
fear accompanied with abhorrence or such a shock to the feelings and sensibilities as may exist without fear,
as when one suddenly encounters some ghastly spectacle; we say of a desperate but fettered criminal, "I
looked upon him with horror." Where horror includes fear, it is fear mingled with abhorrence. (See
ABHOR.) Affright, fright, and terror are always sudden, and in actual presence of that which is terrible. Fear
may overwhelm, or may nerve one to desperate defense; fright and terror render one incapable of defense;
fear may be controlled by force of will; fright and terror overwhelm the will; terror paralyzes, fright may
cause one to fly, to scream, or to swoon. Fright is largely a matter of the nerves; fear of the intellect and the
imagination; terror of all the faculties, bodily and mental. Panic is a sudden fear or fright, affecting numbers
at once; vast armies or crowded audiences are liable to panic upon slight occasion. In a like sense we speak of
a financial panic. Dismay is a helpless sinking of heart in view of some overwhelming peril or sorrow. Dismay
is more reflective, enduring, and despairing than fright; a horse is subject to fright or terror, but not to dismay.
Awe is a reverential fear. Compare ALARM.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for FORTITUDE.
* * * * *
FEMININE.
Synonyms:
effeminate, female, womanish, womanly.
We apply female to the sex, feminine to the qualities, especially the finer physical or mental qualities that
distinguish the female sex in the human family, or to the objects appropriate for or especially employed by
them. A female voice is the voice of a woman; a feminine voice may belong to a man. Womanish denotes the
undesirable, womanly the admirable or lovely qualities of woman. Womanly tears would suggest respect and
sympathy, womanish tears a touch of contempt. The word effeminate is always used reproachfully, and only
of men as possessing womanly traits such as are inconsistent with true manliness.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for MASCULINE.
* * * * *
FETTER.
Synonyms:
bondage, custody, gyves, irons, bonds, durance, handcuffs, manacles, chains, duress, imprisonment, shackles.
Bonds may be of cord, leather, or any other substance that can bind; chains are of linked metal. Manacles and
handcuffs are for the hands, fetters are primarily chains or jointed iron fastenings for the feet; gyves may be
for either. A shackle is a metallic ring, clasp, or bracelet-like fastening for encircling and restraining a limb:
commonly one of a pair, used either for hands or feet. Bonds, fetters, and chains are used in a general way for
almost any form of restraint. Gyves is now wholly poetic, and the other words are mostly restricted to the
literary style; handcuffs is the specific and irons the general term in popular usage; as, the prisoner was put in
irons. Bonds, chains, and shackles are frequently used in the metaphorical sense.
* * * * *
FEUD.
Synonyms:
affray, brawl, contest, dissension, hostility, animosity, broil, controversy, enmity, quarrel, bitterness,
contention, dispute, fray, strife.
A feud is enmity between families, clans, or parties, with acts of hostility mutually retaliated and avenged;
feud is rarely used of individuals, never of nations. While all the other words of the group may refer to that
which is transient, a feud is long-enduring, and often hereditary. Dissension is used of a number of persons, of
a party or other organization. Bitterness is in feeling only; enmity and hostility involve will and purpose to
oppose or injure. A quarrel is in word or act, or both, and is commonly slight and transient, as we speak of
childish quarrels; contention and strife may be in word or deed; contest ordinarily involves some form of
action. Contest is often used in a good sense, contention and strife very rarely so. Controversy is commonly in
words; strife extends from verbal controversy to the contests of armies. Affray, brawl, and broil, like quarrel,
are words of inferior dignity. An affray or broil may arise at a street corner; the affray always involves
physical force; the brawl or broil may be confined to violent language.
* * * * *
FICTION.
Synonyms:
allegory, fabrication, invention, myth, romance, apologue, falsehood, legend, novel, story. fable, figment,
Fiction is now chiefly used of a prose work in narrative form in which the characters are partly or wholly
imaginary, and which is designed to portray human life, with or without a practical lesson; a romance portrays
what is picturesque or striking, as a mere fiction may not do; novel is a general name for any continuous
fictitious narrative, especially a love-story; fiction and novel are used with little difference of meaning, except
that novel characterizes a work in which the emotional element is especially prominent. The moral of the fable
is expressed formally; the lesson of the fiction, if any, is inwrought. A fiction is studied; a myth grows up
without intent. A legend may be true, but can not be historically verified; a myth has been received as true at
some time, but is now known to be false. A fabrication is designed to deceive; it is a less odious word than
falsehood, but is really stronger, as a falsehood may be a sudden unpremeditated statement, while a
fabrication is a series of statements carefully studied and fitted together in order to deceive; the falsehood is
all false; the fabrication may mingle the true with the false. A figment is something imaginary which the one
who utters it may or may not believe to be true; we say, "That statement is a figment of his imagination." The
story may be either true or false, and covers the various senses of all the words in the group. Apologue, a word
simply transferred from Greek into English, is the same as fable. Compare ALLEGORY.
Antonyms:
certainty, fact, history, literalness, reality, truth, verity.
* * * * *
FIERCE.
Synonyms:
ferocious, furious, raging, uncultivated, violent, fiery, impetuous, savage, untrained, wild.
Fierce signifies having a furious and cruel nature, or being in a furious and cruel mood, more commonly the
latter. It applies to that which is now intensely excited, or liable to intense and sudden excitement. Ferocious
refers to a state or disposition; that which is fierce flashes or blazes; that which is ferocious steadily burns; we
speak of a ferocious animal, a fierce passion. A fiery spirit with a good disposition is quickly excitable in a
good cause, but may not be fierce or ferocious. Savage signifies untrained, uncultivated. Ferocious always
denotes a tendency to violence; it is more distinctly bloodthirsty than the other words; a person may be
deeply, intensely cruel, and not at all ferocious; a ferocious countenance expresses habitual ferocity; a fierce
countenance may express habitual fierceness, or only the sudden anger of the moment. That which is wild is
simply unrestrained; the word may imply no anger or harshness; as, wild delight, wild alarm.
Antonyms:
affectionate, gentle, kind, patient, submissive, tame, docile, harmless, mild, peaceful, sweet, tender.
* * * * *
FINANCIAL.
Synonyms:
fiscal, monetary, pecuniary.
These words all relate to money, receipts, or expenditures. Monetary relates to actual money, coin, currency;
as, the monetary system; a monetary transaction is one in which money is transferred. Pecuniary refers to that
in which money is involved, but less directly; we speak of one's pecuniary affairs or interests, with no special
reference to the handling of cash. Financial applies especially to governmental revenues or expenditures, or to
private transactions of considerable moment; we speak of a pecuniary reward, a financial enterprise; we give
a needy person pecuniary (not financial) assistance. It is common to speak of the fiscal rather than the
financial year.
* * * * *
FINE.
Synonyms:
beautiful, excellent, polished, small, clarified, exquisite, pure, smooth, clear, gauzy, refined, splendid,
comminuted, handsome, sensitive, subtile, dainty, keen, sharp, subtle, delicate, minute, slender, tenuous,
elegant, nice, slight, thin.
Fine (L. finis, end) denotes that which has been brought to a full end, finished. From this root-sense many
derived meanings branch out, causing words quite remote from each other to be alike synonyms of fine. That
which is truly finished, brought to an ideal end, is excellent of its kind, and beautiful, if a thing that admits of
beauty; as, a fine house, fine trees, a fine woman, a fine morning; if a thing that admits of the removal of
impurities, it is not finished till these are removed, and hence fine signifies clarified, clear, pure, refined; as,
fine gold. That which is finished is apt to be polished, smooth to the touch, minutely exact in outline; hence
fine comes to be a synonym for all words like dainty, delicate, exquisite; as, fine manners, a fine touch, fine
perceptions. As that which is delicate is apt to be small, by an easy extension of meaning fine becomes a
synonym for slender, slight, minute, comminuted; as, a fine thread, fine sand; or for filmy, tenuous, thin; as, a
fine lace, fine wire; and as a thin edge is keen, sharp, fine becomes also a synonym for these words; as, a fine
point, a fine edge. Compare BEAUTIFUL; MINUTE.
Antonyms:
big, clumsy, great, huge, large, stout, blunt, coarse, heavy, immense, rude, thick.

FIRE.
Synonyms:
blaze, burning, combustion, conflagration, flame.
Combustion is the essential fact which is at the basis of that assemblage of visible phenomenon which we call
fire; combustion being the continuous chemical combination of a substance with some element, as oxygen,
evolving heat, and extending from slow processes, such as those by which the heat of the human body is
maintained, to the processes producing the most intense light also, as in a blast-furnace, or on the surface of
the sun. Fire is always attended with light, as well as heat; blaze, flame, etc., designate the mingled light and
heat of a fire. Combustion is the scientific, fire the popular term. A conflagration is an extensive fire.
Compare LIGHT.

FLOCK.
Synonyms:
bevy, covey, group, herd, lot, set, brood, drove, hatch, litter, pack, swarm.
Group is the general word for any gathering of a small number of objects, whether of persons, animals, or
inanimate things. The individuals in a brood or litter are related to each other; those in the other groups may
not be. Brood is used chiefly of fowls and birds, litter of certain quadrupeds which bring forth many young at
a birth; we speak of a brood of chickens, a litter of puppies; brood is sometimes applied to a family of young
children. Bevy is used of birds, and figuratively of any bright and lively group of women or children, but
rarely of men. Flock is applied to birds and to some of the smaller animals; herd is confined to the larger
animals; we speak of a bevy of quail, a covey of partridges, a flock of blackbirds, or a flock of sheep, a herd of
cattle, horses, buffaloes, or elephants, a pack of wolves, a pack of hounds, a swarm of bees. A collection of
animals driven or gathered for driving is called a drove.
* * * * *
FLUCTUATE.
Synonyms:
hesitate, swerve, vacillate, veer, oscillate, undulate, vary, waver.
To fluctuate (L. fluctus, a wave) is to move like a wave with alternate rise and fall. A pendulum oscillates;
waves fluctuate or undulate; a light or a flame wavers; a frightened steed swerves from his course; a tool or
weapon swerves from the mark or line; the temperature varies; the wind veers when it suddenly changes its
direction. That which veers may steadily hold the new direction; that which oscillates, fluctuates, undulates,
or wavers returns upon its way. As regards mental states, he who hesitates sticks (L. hrere) on the verge of
decision; he who wavers does not stick to a decision; he who vacillates decides now one way, and now
another; one vacillates between contrasted decisions or actions; he may waver between decision and
indecision, or between action and inaction. Persons hesitate, vacillate, waver; feelings fluctuate or vary.
Compare SHAKE.
Antonyms:
abide, adhere, hold fast, persist, stand fast, stay, stick.

FLUID.
Synonyms:
gas, liquid.
A fluid is a substance that, like air or water, yields to any force that tends to change its form; a liquid is a body
in that state in which the particles move freely among themselves, but remain in one mass, keeping the same
volume, but taking always the form of the containing vessel; a liquid is an inelastic fluid; a gas is an elastic
fluid that tends to expand to the utmost limits of the containing space. All liquids are fluids, but not all fluids
are liquids; air and all the gases are fluids, but they are not liquids under ordinary circumstances, tho capable
of being reduced to a liquid form by special means, as by cold and pressure. Water at the ordinary temperature
is at once a fluid and a liquid.
* * * * *
FOLLOW.
Synonyms:
accompany, come after, go after, obey, pursue, attend, copy, heed, observe, result, chase, ensue, imitate,
practise, succeed.
Anything that comes after or goes after another, either in space or in time, is said to follow it. A servant
follows or attends his master; a victorious general may follow the retiring enemy merely to watch and hold
him in check; he chases or pursues with intent to overtake and attack; the chase is closer and hotter than the
pursuit. (Compare synonyms for HUNT.) One event may follow another either with or without special
connection; if it ensues, there is some orderly connection; as, the ensuing year; if it results from another, there
is some relation of effect, consequence, or inference. A clerk observes his employer's directions. A child
obeys his parent's commands, follows or copies his example, imitates his speech and manners. The compositor
follows copy; the incoming succeeds the outgoing official.
* * * * *
FOOD.
Synonyms:
aliment, feed, nourishment, pabulum, sustenance, diet, fodder, nutriment, provender, viands, fare, forage,
nutrition, regimen, victuals.
Food is, in the popular sense, whatever one eats in contradistinction to what one drinks. Thus, we speak of
food and drink, of wholesome, unwholesome, or indigestible food; but in a more scientific sense whatever,
when taken into the digestive organs, serves to build up structure or supply waste may be termed food; the
word is extended to plants to signify whatever taken in any way into the organism serves similar purposes;
thus, we speak of liquid food, plant food, etc.; in this wider sense food is closely synonymous with nutriment,
nourishment, and sustenance. Diet refers to the quantity and quality of food habitually taken, with reference to
preservation of health. Victuals is a plain, homely word for whatever may be eaten; we speak of choice
viands, cold victuals. Nourishment and sustenance apply to whatever can be introduced into the system as a
means of sustaining life; we say of a convalescent, he is taking nourishment. Nutriment and nutrition have
more of scientific reference to the vitalizing principles of various foods; thus, wheat is said to contain a great
amount of nutriment. Regimen considers food as taken by strict rule, but applies more widely to the whole
ordering of life. Fare is a general word for all table supplies, good or bad; as, sumptuous fare; wretched fare.
Feed, fodder, and provender are used only of the food of the lower animals, feed denoting anything
consumed, but more commonly grain, fodder denoting hay, cornstalks, or the like, sometimes called "long
feed;" provender is dry feed, whether grain or hay, straw, etc. Forage denotes any kind of food suitable for
horses and cattle, primarily as obtained by a military force in scouring the country, especially an enemy's
country.
* * * * *
FORMIDABLE.
Synonyms:
dangerous, redoubted, terrible, tremendous.
That which is formidable is worthy of fear if encountered or opposed; as, a formidable array of troops, or of
evidence. Formidable is a word of more dignity than dangerous, and suggests more calm and collected power
than terrible; formidable is less overwhelming than tremendous. A loaded gun is dangerous; a park of artillery
is formidable; a charge of cavalry is terrible; the full shock of great armies is tremendous. A dangerous man is
likely to do mischief, and needs watching; a formidable man may not be dangerous if not attacked; an enraged
maniac is terrible; the force of ocean waves in a storm, and the silent pressure in the ocean depths, are
tremendous.
Antonyms:
contemptible, feeble, harmless, helpless, powerless, weak. despicable,
Prepositions:
Formidable by or in numbers; in strength; formidable to the enemy.
* * * * *
FORTIFICATION.
Synonyms:
castle, citadel, fastness, fort, fortress, stronghold.
Fortification is the general word for any artificial defensive work; a fortress is a fortification of especial size
and strength; a fortress is regarded as permanent, and is ordinarily an independent work; a fort or fortification
may be temporary; a fortification may be but part of a defensive system; we speak of the fortifications of a
city. A citadel is a fortification within a city, or the fortified inner part of a city or fortress, within which a
garrison may be placed to overawe the citizens, or to which the defenders may retire if the outer works are
captured; the medieval castle was the fortified residence of a king or baron. Fort is the common military term
for a detached fortified building or enclosure of moderate size occupied or designed to be occupied by troops.
The fortifications of a modern city usually consist of a chain of forts. Any defensible place, whether made so
by nature or by art, is a fastness or stronghold.
* * * * *
FORTITUDE.
Synonyms:
courage, endurance, heroism, resolution.
Fortitude (L. fortis, strong) is the strength or firmness of mind or soul to endure pain or adversity patiently
and determinedly. Fortitude has been defined as "passive courage," which is a good definition, but not
complete. Fortitude might be termed "still courage," or "enduring courage;" it is that quality which is able not
merely to endure pain or trial, but steadily to confront dangers that can not be actively opposed, or against
which one has no adequate defense; it takes courage to charge a battery, fortitude to stand still under an
enemy's fire. Resolution is of the mind; endurance is partly physical; it requires resolution to resist
temptation, endurance to resist hunger and cold. Compare BRAVE; PATIENCE.
* * * * *
FORTUNATE.
Synonyms:
favored, lucky, prospered, prosperous, successful. happy,
A man is successful in any case if he achieves or gains what he seeks; he is known as a successful man if he
has achieved or gained worthy objects of endeavor; he is fortunate or lucky if advantages have come to him
without or beyond his direct planning or achieving. Lucky is the more common and colloquial, fortunate the
more elegant word; fortunate is more naturally applied to the graver matters, as we speak of the fortunate,
rather than the lucky, issue of a great battle; lucky more strongly emphasizes the element of chance, as when
we speak of a lucky hit, a lucky guess, or of one as "born under a lucky star." Favored is used in a religious
sense, implying that one is the object of divine favor. Happy, in this connection, signifies possessed of the
means of happiness. One is said to be happy or prosperous whether his prosperity be the result of fortune or of
achievement; prospered rather denotes the action of a superintending Providence.
Antonyms:
broken, fallen, miserable, unhappy, woful, crushed, ill-starred, unfortunate, unlucky, wretched.
* * * * *
FRAUD.
Synonyms:
artifice, deceit, duplicity, swindle, treason, cheat, deception, imposition, swindling, trick. cheating, dishonesty,
imposture, treachery,
A fraud is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of
another. A deceit or deception may be designed merely to gain some end of one's own, with no intent of
harming another; an imposition, to take some small advantage of another, or simply to make another
ridiculous. An imposture is designed to obtain money, credit, or position to which one is not entitled, and may
be practised by a street beggar or by the pretender to a throne. All action that is not honest is dishonesty, but
the term dishonesty is generally applied in business, politics, etc., to deceitful practises which are not directly
criminal. Fraud includes deceit, but deceit may not reach the gravity of fraud; a cheat is of the nature of
fraud, but of a petty sort; a swindle is more serious than a cheat, involving larger values and more flagrant
dishonesty. Fraud is commonly actionable at law; cheating and swindling are for the most part out of the
reach of legal proceedings. Treachery is chiefly used of dishonesty in matters of friendship, social relations,
government, or war; treachery may be more harmful than fraud, but is not so gross, and is not ordinarily open
to legal redress. Treason is a specific form of treachery of a subject to the government to which he owes
allegiance, and is definable and punishable at law. Compare ARTIFICE; DECEPTION.
Antonyms:
fairness, good faith, honesty, integrity, truth, uprightness.

FRIENDLY.
Synonyms:
accessible, companionable, genial, neighborly, affable, complaisant, hearty, sociable, affectionate, cordial,
kind, social, amicable, favorable, kindly, tender, brotherly, fond, loving, well-disposed.
Friendly, as said of persons, signifies having the disposition of a friend; as said of acts, it signifies befitting or
worthy of a friend. The adjective friendly does not reach the full significance of the nouns "friend" and
"friendship;" one may be friendly to those who are not his friends, and to be in friendly relations often
signifies little more than not to be hostile. In its application to persons, accessible is used of public and
eminent persons, who might, if disposed, hold themselves at a distance from others. Companionable and
sociable refer to manner and behavior, cordial and genial express genuine kindliness of heart. We speak of a
cordial greeting, a favorable reception, a neighborly call, a sociable visitor, an amicable settlement, a kind
interest, a friendly regard, a hearty welcome. The Saxon friendly is stronger than the Latin amicable; the
amicable may be merely formal; the friendly is from the heart. Fond is commonly applied to an affection that
becomes, or at least appears, excessive. Affectionate, devoted, and tender are almost always used in a high and
good sense; as, an affectionate son; a devoted friend; "the tender mercy of our God," Luke i, 78. Compare
FRIENDSHIP.
Antonyms:
adverse, belligerent, distant, ill-disposed, unfriendly, alienated, cold, estranged, indifferent, unkind,
antagonistic, contentious, frigid, inimical, warlike. bellicose, disaffected, hostile,
* * * * *
FRIENDSHIP.
Synonyms:
affection, comity, esteem, good will, amity, consideration, favor, love, attachment, devotion, friendliness,
regard.
Friendship is a deep, quiet, enduring affection, founded upon mutual respect and esteem. Friendship is always
mutual; there may be unreciprocated affection or attachment, unrequited love, or even unrecognized and
unappreciated devotion, but never unreciprocated or unrequited friendship; one may have friendly feelings
toward an enemy, but while there is hostility or coldness on one side there can not be friendship between the
two. Friendliness is a quality of friendly feeling, without the deep and settled attachment implied in the state
of friendship. Comity is mutual kindly courtesy, with care of each other's right, and amity a friendly feeling
and relation, not necessarily implying special friendliness; as, the comity of nations, or amity between
neighboring countries. Affection may be purely natural; friendship is a growth. Friendship is more intellectual
and less emotional than love; it is easier to give reasons for friendship than for love; friendship is more calm
and quiet, love more fervent; love often rises to intensest passion; we can not speak of the passion of
friendship. Friendship implies some degree of equality, while love does not; we can speak of man's love
toward God, not of his friendship for God. (There is more latitude in the use of the concrete noun friend;
Abraham was called "the friend of God;" Christ was called "the friend of sinners.") Compare
ACQUAINTANCE; LOVE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for BATTLE; ENMITY; FEUD; HATRED.
Prepositions:
The friendship of one person for or toward another, or the friendship between them.
* * * * *
FRIGHTEN.
Synonyms:
affright, appal, cow, dismay, scare, alarm, browbeat, daunt, intimidate, terrify.
One is frightened by a cause of fear addressed directly and suddenly to the senses; he is intimidated by an
apprehension of contingent consequences dependent on some act of his own to be done or forborne; the means
of intimidation may act through the senses, or may appeal only to the intellect or the sensibilities. The sudden
rush of an armed madman may frighten; the quiet leveling of a highwayman's pistol intimidates. A savage
beast is intimidated by the keeper's whip. Employers may intimidate their employees from voting contrary to
their will by threat of discharge; a mother may be intimidated through fear for her child. To browbeat or cow
is to bring into a state of submissive fear; to daunt is to give pause or check to a violent, threatening, or even a
brave spirit. To scare is to cause sudden, unnerving fear; to terrify is to awaken fear that is overwhelming.
Compare ALARM.
* * * * *
FRUGALITY.
Synonyms:
economy, parsimony, saving, sparing, miserliness, providence, scrimping, thrift. parsimoniousness, prudence,
Economy is a wise and careful administration of the means at one's disposal; frugality is a withholding of
expenditure, or sparing of supplies or provision, to a noticeable and often to a painful degree; parsimony is
excessive and unreasonable saving for the sake of saving. Frugality exalted into a virtue to be practised for its
own sake, instead of as a means to an end, becomes the vice of parsimony. Miserliness is the denying oneself
and others the ordinary comforts or even necessaries of life, for the mere sake of hoarding money. Prudence
and providence look far ahead, and sacrifice the present to the future, saving as much as may be necessary for
that end. (See PRUDENCE.) Thrift seeks not merely to save, but to earn. Economy manages, frugality saves,
providence plans, thrift at once earns and saves, with a view to wholesome and profitable expenditure at a
fitting time. See ABSTINENCE.
Antonyms:
abundance, bounty, liberality, opulence, waste, affluence, extravagance, luxury, riches, wealth.
* * * * *
GARRULOUS.
Synonyms:
chattering, loquacious, talkative, verbose.
Garrulous signifies given to constant trivial talking. Chattering signifies uttering rapid, noisy, and
unintelligible, or scarcely intelligible, sounds, whether articulate words or such as resemble them; chattering
is often used of vocal sounds that may be intelligible by themselves but are ill understood owing to confusion
of many voices or other cause. The talkative person has a strong disposition to talk, with or without an
abundance of words, or many ideas; the loquacious person has an abundant flow of language and much to say
on any subject suggested; either may be lively and for a time entertaining; the garrulous person is tedious,
repetitious, petty, and self-absorbed. Verbose is applied to utterances more formal than conversation, as to
writings or public addresses. We speak of a chattering monkey or a chattering idiot, a talkative child, a
talkative or loquacious woman, a garrulous old man, a verbose writer. Compare CIRCUMLOCUTION.
Antonyms:
laconic, reserved, reticent, silent, speechless, taciturn.
* * * * *
GENDER.
Synonym:
sex.
Sex is a distinction among living beings; it is also the characteristic by which most living beings are
distinguished from inanimate things, which are of no sex; gender is a distinction in language partially
corresponding to this distinction in nature; while there are but two sexes, there are in some languages, as in
English and German, three genders. The French language has but two genders and makes the names of all
inanimate objects either masculine or feminine; some languages are without the distinction of gender, and
those that maintain it are often quite arbitrary in its application. We speak of the masculine or feminine
gender, the male or female sex.
* * * * *
GENERAL.
Synonyms:
common, familiar, ordinary, universal, commonplace, frequent, popular, usual. customary, habitual, prevalent,
everyday, normal, public,
Common signifies frequently occurring, not out of the regular course, not exceptional; hence, not above the
average, not excellent or distinguished, inferior, or even low; common also signifies pertaining to or
participated in by two or more persons or things; as, sorrow is common to the race. General may signify
pertaining equally to all of a class, race, etc., but very commonly signifies pertaining to the greater number,
but not necessarily to all. Universal applies to all without exception; general applies to all with possible or
comparatively slight exceptions; common applies to very many without deciding whether they are even a
majority. A common remark is one we often hear; a general experience is one that comes to the majority of
people; a universal experience is one from which no human being is exempt. It is dangerous for a debater to
affirm a universal proposition, since that can be negatived by a single exception, while a general statement is
not invalidated even by adducing many exceptions. We say a common opinion, common experience, a general
rule, general truth, a universal law. Compare synonyms for NORMAL; USUAL.
Antonyms:
exceptional, infrequent, rare, singular, uncommon, unknown, unusual.
* * * * *
GENEROUS.
Synonyms:
bountiful, free, liberal, noble, chivalrous, free-handed, magnanimous, open-handed, disinterested,
free-hearted, munificent, open-hearted.
Generous (L. genus, a race) primarily signifies having the qualities worthy of noble or honorable birth; hence,
free and abundant in giving, giving freely, heartily, and self-sacrificingly. As regards giving, generous refers
rather to the self-sacrificing heartiness of the giver, liberal to the amount of the gift; a child may show himself
generous in the gift of an apple, a millionaire makes a liberal donation; a generous gift, however, is
commonly thought of as both ample and hearty. A munificent gift is vast in amount, whatever the motive of its
bestowal. One may be free with another's money; he can be generous only with his own. Disinterested
suggests rather the thought of one's own self-denial; generous, of one's hearty interest in another's welfare or
happiness. One is magnanimous by a greatness of soul (L. magnus, great, and animus, soul) that rises above
all that is poor, mean, or weak, especially above every petty or ignoble motive or feeling pertaining to one's
self, and thus above resentment of injury or insult; one is generous by a kindness of heart that would rejoice in
the welfare rather than in the punishment of the offender.
Antonyms:
avaricious, greedy, mean, niggardly, penurious, rapacious, close, ignoble, miserly, parsimonious, petty, stingy.
covetous, illiberal,

GENIUS.
Synonyms:
talent, talents.
Genius is exalted intellectual power capable of operating independently of tuition and training, and marked by
an extraordinary faculty for original creation, invention, discovery, expression, etc. Talent is marked mental
ability, and in a special sense, a particular and uncommon aptitude for some special mental work or
attainment. Genius is higher than talent, more spontaneous, less dependent upon instruction, less amenable to
training; talent is largely the capacity to learn, acquire, appropriate, adapt oneself to demand. Yet the genius
that has won the largest and most enduring success has been joined with tireless industry and painstaking.

dulness, folly, imbecility, obtuseness, senselessness, stupidity.

GET.
Synonyms:
achieve, attain, gain, procure, secure, acquire, earn, obtain, receive, win.
Get is a most comprehensive word. A person gets whatever he comes to possess or experience, whether with
or without endeavor, expectation, or desire; he gets a bargain, a blow, a fall, a fever; he gains what he comes
to by effort or striving; the swimmer gains the shore; a man acquires by continuous and ordinarily by slow
process; as, one acquires a foreign language. A person is sometimes said to gain and often to acquire what
has not been an object of direct endeavor; in the pursuits of trade, he incidentally gains some knowledge of
foreign countries; he acquires by association with others a correct or incorrect accent; he acquires a bronzed
complexion by exposure to a tropical sun; in such use, what he gains is viewed as desirable, what he acquires
as slowly and gradually resulting. A person earns what he gives an equivalent of labor for, tho he may not get
it. On the other hand, he may get what he has not earned; the temptation to all dishonesty is the desire to get a
living or a fortune without earning it. When one gets the object of his desire, he is said to obtain it, whether he
has gained or earned it or not. Win denotes contest, with a suggestion of chance or hazard; in popular
language, a person is often said to win a lawsuit, or to win in a suit at law, but in legal phrase he is said to gain
his suit, case, or cause. In receiving, one is strictly passive; he may get an estate by his own exertions or by
inheritance; in the latter case he is said to receive it. One obtains a thing commonly by some direct effort of
his own; he procures it commonly by the intervention of some one else; he procures a dinner or an interview;
he secures what has seemed uncertain or elusive, when he gets it firmly into his possession or under his
control. Compare synonyms for ATTAIN; MAKE; REACH.

GIFT.
Synonyms:
benefaction, boon, bribe, grant, largess, bequest, bounty, donation, gratuity, present.
A gift is in the popular, and also in the legal sense that which is voluntarily bestowed without expectation of
return or compensation. Gift is now almost always used in the good sense, bribe always in the evil sense to
signify payment for a dishonorable service under the semblance of a gift. In Scriptural language gift is often
used for bribe. "The king by judgment establisheth the land; but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it." Prov.
xxix, 4. A benefaction is a charitable gift, generally of large amount, and viewed as of enduring value, as an
endowment for a college. A donation is something, perhaps of great, never of trivial value, given usually on
some public ground, as to a cause or to a person representing a cause, but not necessarily of value beyond the
immediate present; as, a donation to a pastor. A gratuity is usually something of moderate value and is always
given as to an inferior, and as of favor, not of right; as, a gratuity to a waiter. Largess is archaic for a bountiful
gratuity, usually to be distributed among many, as among the heralds at ancient tournaments. A present is a
gift of friendship, or conciliation, and given as to an equal or a superior; no one's pride is hurt by accepting
what is viewed as strictly a present. A boon is a gift that has been desired or craved or perhaps asked, or
something freely given that meets some great desire. A grant is commonly considerable in amount and given
by public authority; as, a grant of public lands for a college.
Antonyms:
compensation, earnings, guerdon, penalty, remuneration, wages.
* * * * *
GIVE.
Synonyms:
bestow, communicate, deliver, grant, supply. cede, confer, furnish, impart,
To give is primarily to transfer to another's possession or ownership without compensation; in its secondary
sense in popular use, it is to put into another's possession by any means and on any terms whatever; a buyer
may say "Give me the goods, and I will give you the money;" we speak of giving answers, information, etc.,
and often of giving what is not agreeable to the recipient, as blows, medicine, reproof; but when there is
nothing in the context to indicate the contrary, give is always understood in its primary sense; as, this book
was given me. Give thus becomes, like get, a term of such general import as to be a synonym for a wide
variety of words. To grant is to put into one's possession in some formal way, or by authoritative act; as,
Congress grants lands to a railroad corporation. To speak of granting a favor carries a claim or concession of
superiority on the part of the one by whom the grant may be made; to confer has a similar sense; as, to confer
a degree or an honor; we grant a request or petition, but do not confer it. To impart is to give of that which
one still, to a greater or less degree, retains; the teacher imparts instruction. To bestow is to give that of which
the receiver stands in especial need; we bestow alms.
Prepositions:
We give money to a person for a thing, for a purpose, etc. (or without proposition, give a person a sum of
money); we give a thing to or into one's care or keeping; the weary fugitive gave himself up to his pursuers.
* * * * *
GOVERN.
Synonyms:
command, curb, influence, mold, reign over, rule, control, direct, manage, reign, restrain, sway.
Govern carries the idea of authoritative administration or some exercise of authority that is at once effective
and continuous; control is effective, but may be momentary or occasional. One controls what he holds or can
hold at will absolutely in check; as, a skilful horseman controls a spirited horse; a person controls his temper;
we say to one who is excited, "control yourself." A person commands another when he has, or claims, the
right to make that other do his will, with power of inflicting penalty if not obeyed; he controls another whom
he can effectually prevent from doing anything contrary to his will; he governs one whom he actually does
cause, regularly or constantly, to obey his will; a parent may command a child whom he can not govern or
control. The best teachers are not greatly prone to command, but govern or control their pupils largely by
other means. Command is, however, often used in the sense of securing, as well as requiring, submission or
obedience, as when we speak of a commanding influence; a man commands the situation when he can shape
events as he pleases; a fortress commands the region when no enemy can pass against its resistance. Govern
implies the exercise of knowledge and judgment as well as power. To rule is more absolute and autocratic
than to govern; to sway is to move by quiet but effectual influence; to mold is not only to influence feeling and
action, but to shape character; to manage is to secure by skilful contrivance the doing of one's will by those
whom one can not directly control; a wise mother, by gentle means, sways the feelings and molds the lives of
her children; to be able to manage servants is an important element of good housekeeping. The word reign,
once so absolute, now simply denotes that one holds the official station of sovereign in a monarchy, with or
without effective power; the Queen of England reigns; the Czar of Russia both reigns and rules.
Antonyms:
be in subjection, be subject, comply, obey, submit, yield.

GRACEFUL.
Synonym:
beautiful.
That which is graceful is marked by elegance and harmony, with ease of action, attitude, or posture, or
delicacy of form. Graceful commonly suggests motion or the possibility of motion; beautiful may apply to
absolute fixity; a landscape or a blue sky is beautiful, but neither is graceful. Graceful commonly applies to
beauty as addressed to the eye, tho we often speak of a graceful poem or a graceful compliment. Graceful
applies to the perfection of motion, especially of the lighter motions, which convey no suggestion of stress or
strain, and are in harmonious curves. Apart from the thought of motion, graceful denotes a pleasing harmony
of outline, proportion, etc., with a certain degree of delicacy; a Hercules is massive, an Apollo is graceful. We
speak of a graceful attitude, graceful drapery. Compare BEAUTIFUL; BECOMING.

GRIEF.
Synonyms:
affliction, melancholy, regret, sorrow, trouble, distress, mourning, sadness, tribulation, wo.
Grief is acute mental pain resulting from loss, misfortune, or deep disappointment. Grief is more acute and
less enduring than sorrow. Sorrow and grief are for definite cause; sadness and melancholy may arise from a
vague sense of want or loss, from a low state of health, or other ill-defined cause; sadness may be momentary;
melancholy is more enduring, and may become chronic. Affliction expresses a deep heart-sorrow and is
applied also to the misfortune producing such sorrow; mourning most frequently denotes sorrow publicly
expressed, or the public expression of such sorrow as may reasonably be expected; as, it is common to
observe thirty days of mourning on the death of an officer of state.

custom, habitude, routine, system, use, fashion, practise, rule, usage, wont.
Habit is a tendency or inclination toward an action or condition, which by repetition has become easy,
spontaneous, or even unconscious, or an action or regular series of actions, or a condition so induced. Custom
is the uniform doing of the same act in the same circumstance for a definite reason; routine is the doing of
customary acts in a regular and uniform sequence and is more mechanical than custom. It is the custom of
tradesmen to open at a uniform hour, and to follow a regular routine of business until closing-time. Habit
always includes an involuntary tendency, natural or acquired, greatly strengthened by frequent repetition of
the act, and may be uncontrollable, or even unconscious. Habitude is habitual relation or association. Custom
is chiefly used of the action of many; habit of the action of one; we speak of the customs of society, the habits
of an individual. Fashion is the generally recognized custom in the smaller matters, especially in dress. A rule
is prescribed either by some external authority or by one's own will; as, it is the rule of the house; or, I make it
my invariable rule. System is the coordination of many acts or things into a unity, and is more and better than
routine. Use and usage denote the manner of using something; we speak of one person's use of language, but
of the usage of many; a use or usage is almost always a habit. Practise is the active doing of something in a
systematic way; we do not speak of the practise, but of the habit of going to sleep; we speak of a tradesman's
custom, a lawyer's or a physician's practise. Educationally, practise is the voluntary and persistent attempt to
make skill a habit; as, practise in penmanship. Wont is blind and instinctive habit like that which attaches an
animal to a locality: the word is now almost wholly poetic. Compare DRESS.

HAPPEN.
Synonyms:
bechance, chance, fall out, supervene, befall, come to pass, occur, take place. betide, fall,
A thing is said to happen when no design is manifest, or none especially thought of; it is said to chance when
it appears to be the result of accident (compare synonyms for ACCIDENT). An incident happens or occurs;
something external or actual happens to one; a thought or fancy occurs to him. Befall and betide are transitive;
happen is intransitive; something befalls or betides a person or happens to him. Betide is especially used for
anticipated evil, thought of as waiting and coming at its appointed time; as, wo betide him! One event
supervenes upon another event, one disease upon another, etc. ["Transpire," in the sense of happen, is not
authorized by good usage: a thing that has happened is properly said to transpire when it becomes known.]
Prepositions:
An event happens to a person; a person happens on or upon a fact, discovery, etc.

HAPPINESS.
Synonyms:
blessedness, delight, gladness, pleasure, bliss, ecstasy, gratification, rapture, cheer, enjoyment, joy, rejoicing,
comfort, felicity, merriment, satisfaction, contentment, gaiety, mirth, triumph.
Gratification is the giving any mental or physical desire something that it craves; satisfaction is the giving
such a desire all that it craves. Happiness is the positively agreeable experience that springs from the
possession of good, the gratification or satisfaction of the desires or the relief from pain and evil. Comfort
may be almost wholly negative, being found in security or relief from that which pains or annoys; there is
comfort by a warm fireside on a wintry night; the sympathy of a true friend affords comfort in sorrow.
Enjoyment is more positive, always implying something to be definitely and consciously delighted in; a sick
person finds comfort in relief from pain, while he may be far from a state of enjoyment. Pleasure is still more
vivid, being an arousing of the faculties to an intensely agreeable activity; satisfaction is more tranquil than
pleasure, being the agreeable consciousness of having all that our faculties demand or crave; when a worthy
pleasure is past, a worthy satisfaction remains. As referring to a mental state, gratification is used to denote a
mild form of happiness resulting from some incident not of very great importance; satisfaction should
properly express a happiness deeper, more complete, and more abiding; but as intellect or sensibilities of a
low order may find satisfaction in that which is very poor or unworthy, the word has come to be feeble and
tame in ordinary use. Happiness is more positive than comfort, enjoyment, or satisfaction, more serene and
rational than pleasure; pleasure is of necessity transient; happiness is abiding, and may be eternal; thus, we
speak of pleasures, but the plural of happiness is scarcely used. Happiness, in the full sense, is mental or
spiritual or both, and is viewed as resulting from some worthy gratification or satisfaction; we may speak of a
brute as experiencing comfort or pleasure, but scarcely as in possession of happiness; we speak of vicious
pleasure, delight, or joy, but not of vicious happiness. Felicity is a philosophical term, colder and more formal
than happiness. Gladness is happiness that overflows, expressing itself in countenance, voice, manner, and
action. Joy is more intense than happiness, deeper than gladness, to which it is akin, nobler and more enduring
than pleasure. Gaiety is more superficial than joy, more demonstrative than gladness. Rejoicing is happiness
or joy that finds utterance in word, song, festivity, etc. Delight is vivid, overflowing happiness of a somewhat
transient kind; ecstasy is a state of extreme or extravagant delight so that the one affected by it seems almost
beside himself with joy; rapture is closely allied to ecstasy, but is more serene, exalted, and enduring.
Triumph is such joy as results from victory, success, achievement. Blessedness is at once the state and the
sense of being divinely blessed; as, the blessedness of the righteous. Bliss is ecstatic, perfected happiness; as,
the bliss of heaven. Compare COMFORT.

HAPPY.
Synonyms:
blessed, cheering, gay, lucky, rejoiced, blissful, cheery, glad, merry, rejoicing, blithe, delighted, jocund,
mirthful, smiling, blithesome, delightful, jolly, pleased, sprightly, bright, dexterous, joyful, prosperous,
successful, buoyant, felicitous, joyous, rapturous, sunny. cheerful, fortunate,
Happy primarily refers to something that comes "by good hap," a chance that brings prosperity, benefit, or
success.
And grasps the skirts of happy chance.
TENNYSON In Memoriam lxiii, st. 2.
In this sense happy is closely allied to fortunate and lucky. (See FORTUNATE.) Happy has, however, so far
diverged from this original sense as to apply to advantages where chance is not recognized, or is even
excluded by direct reference to the divine will, when it becomes almost equivalent to blessed.
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth.
Job v, 17.
Happy is also applied to the ready dexterity or skill by which favorable results (usually in minor matters) are
secured, when it becomes a synonym for dexterous, felicitous, and the associated words; as, he has a happy
wit; happy at retort (compare CLEVER). In its most frequent present use, happy is applied to the state of one
enjoying happiness, or to that by which happiness is expressed; as, a happy heart; a happy face; happy
laughter; happy tears (compare synonyms for HAPPINESS). Cheerful applies to the possession or expression
of a moderate and tranquil happiness. A cheery word spontaneously gives cheer to others; a cheering word is
more distinctly planned to cheer and encourage. Gay applies to an effusive and superficial happiness (often
not really worthy of that name) perhaps resulting largely from abundant animal spirits: we speak of gay
revelers or a gay horse. A buoyant spirit is, as it were, borne up by joy and hope. A sunny disposition has a
constant tranquil brightness that irradiates all who come within its influence.

Prepositions:
A happy event for him; happy at a reply; happy in his home, with his friends, among his children; happy at the
discovery, over his success.

HARMONY.
Synonyms:
accord, concurrence, consistency, uniformity, accordance, conformity, consonance, union, agreement,
congruity, symmetry, unison, amity, consent, unanimity, unity. concord,
When tones, thoughts, or feelings, individually different, combine to form a consistent and pleasing whole,
there is harmony. Harmony is deeper and more essential than agreement; we may have a superficial, forced,
or patched-up agreement, but never a superficial, forced, or patched-up harmony. Concord is less full and
spiritual than harmony. Concord implies more volition than accord; as, their views were found to be in perfect
accord; or, by conference concord was secured; we do not secure accord, but discover it. We may speak of
being in accord with a person on one point, but harmony is wider in range. Conformity is correspondence in
form, manner, or use; the word often signifies submission to authority or necessity, and may be as far as
possible from harmony; as, the attempt to secure conformity to an established religion. Congruity involves the
element of suitableness; consistency implies the absence of conflict or contradiction in views, statements, or
acts which are brought into comparison, as in the different statements of the same person or the different
periods of one man's life; unanimity is the complete hearty agreement of many; consent and concurrence refer
to decision or action, but consent is more passive than concurrence; one speaks by general consent when no
one in the assembly cares to make formal objection; a decision of the Supreme Court depends upon the
concurrence of a majority of the judges. Compare AGREE; FRIENDSHIP; MELODY.
Antonyms:
antagonism, contest, discord, hostility, schism, battle, controversy, disproportion, incongruity, separation,
conflict, difference, dissension, inconsistency, variance, contention, disagreement, disunion, opposition,
warfare.

HARVEST.
Synonyms:
crop, harvest-home, ingathering, result, fruit, harvesting, proceeds, return, growth, harvest-tide, produce,
yield. harvest-feast, harvest-time, product, harvest-festival, increase, reaping,
Harvest, from the Anglo-Saxon, signified originally "autumn," and as that is the usual season of gathering
ripened crops in Northern lands, the word came to its present meaning of the season of gathering ripened
grain or fruits, whether summer or autumn, and hence a crop gathered or ready for gathering; also, the act or
process of gathering a crop or crops. "The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few," Luke x, 2. "Lift up
your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest," John iv, 35. Harvest is the elegant and
literary word; crop is the common and commercial expression; we say a man sells his crop, but we should not
speak of his selling his harvest; we speak of an ample or abundant harvest, a good crop. Harvest is applied
almost wholly to grain; crop applies to almost anything that is gathered in; we speak of the potato-crop, not
the potato-harvest; we may say either the wheat-crop or the wheat-harvest. Produce is a collective word for
all that is produced in farming or gardening, and is, in modern usage, almost wholly restricted to this sense;
we speak of produce collectively, but of a product or various products; vegetables, fruits, eggs, butter, etc.,
may be termed farm-produce, or the products of the farm. Product is a word of wider application than
produce; we speak of the products of manufacturing, the products of thought, or the product obtained by
multiplying one number by another. The word proceeds is chiefly used of the return from an investment: we
speak of the produce of a farm, but of the proceeds of the money invested in farming. The yield is what the
land gives up to the farmer's demand; we speak of the return from an expenditure of money or labor, but of
the yield of corn or oats. Harvest has also a figurative use, such as crop more rarely permits; we term a
religious revival a harvest of souls; the result of lax enforcement of law is a harvest of crime. As regards time,
harvest, harvest-tide, and harvest-time alike denote the period or season when the crops are or should be
gathered (tide being simply the old Saxon word for time). Harvest-home ordinarily denotes the festival of
harvest, and when used to denote simply the season always gives a suggestion of festivity and rejoicing, such
as harvest and harvest-time by themselves do not express.
* * * * *
HATRED.
Synonyms:
abhorrence, detestation, hostility, rancor, anger, dislike, ill will, repugnance, animosity, enmity, malevolence,
resentment, antipathy, grudge, malice, revenge, aversion, hate, malignity, spite.
Repugnance applies to that which one feels himself summoned or impelled to do or to endure, and from which
he instinctively draws back. Aversion is the turning away of the mind or feelings from some person or thing,
or from some course of action, etc. Hate, or hatred, as applied to persons, is intense and continued aversion,
usually with disposition to injure; anger is sudden and brief, hatred is lingering and enduring; "Her wrath
became a hate," TENNYSON Pelleas and Ettarre st. 16. As applied to things, hatred is intense aversion, with
desire to destroy or remove; hatred of evil is a righteous passion, akin to abhorrence, but more vehement.
Malice involves the active intent to injure; in the legal sense, malice is the intent to injure, even tho with no
personal ill will; as, a highwayman would be said to entertain malice toward the unknown traveler whom he
attacks. Malice is direct, pressing toward a result; malignity is deep, lingering, and venomous, tho often
impotent to act; rancor (akin to rancid) is cherished malignity that has soured and festered and is virulent and
implacable. Spite is petty malice that delights to inflict stinging pain; grudge is deeper than spite; it is sinister
and bitter; grudge, resentment, and revenge are all retaliatory, grudge being the disposition, revenge the
determination to repay real or supposed offense with injury; revenge may denote also the retaliatory act;
resentment, the best word of the three, always holds itself to be justifiable, but looks less certainly to action
than grudge or revenge. Simple goodness may arouse the hatred of the wicked; they will be moved to revenge
only by what they deem an injury or affront. Compare ABOMINATION; ANGER; ANTIPATHY; ENMITY.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for FRIENDSHIP; LOVE.

HAVE.
Synonyms:
be in possession of, hold, occupy, own, possess. be possessed of,
Have is the most general word, and is applied to whatever belongs to or is connected with one; a man has a
head or a head-ache, a fortune or an opinion, a friend or an enemy; he has time, or has need; he may be said to
have what is his own, what he has borrowed, what has been entrusted to him, or what he has stolen. To
possess a thing is to have the ownership with control and enjoyment of it. To hold is to have in one's hand, or
securely in one's control; a man holds his friend's coat for a moment, or he holds a struggling horse; he holds a
promissory note, or holds an office. To own is to have the right of property in; to possess is to have that right
in actual exercise; to occupy is to have possession and use, with some degree of permanency, with or without
ownership. A man occupies his own house or a room in a hotel; a man may own a farm of which he is not in
possession because a tenant occupies it and is determined to hold it; the proprietor owns the property, but the
tenant is in possession. To be in possession differs from possess in that to possess denotes both right and fact,
while to be in possession denotes simply the fact with no affirmation as to the right. To have reason is to be
endowed with the faculty; to be in possession of one's reason denotes that the faculty is in actual present
exercise.

HAZARD.
Synonyms:
accident, chance, danger, jeopardy, risk, casualty, contingency, fortuity, peril, venture.
Hazard is the incurring the possibility of loss or harm for the possibility of benefit; danger may have no
compensating alternative. In hazard the possibilities of gain or loss are nearly balanced; in risk the possibility
of loss is the chief thought; the foolhardy take great risks in mere wantonness; in chance and venture the hope
of good predominates; we speak of a merchant's venture, but of an insurance company's risk; one may be
driven by circumstances to run a risk; he freely seeks a venture; we speak of the chance of winning, the
hazard or risk of losing. Accidents are incalculable; casualties may be to a certain extent anticipated; death
and wounds are casualties of battle, certain to happen to some, but uncertain as to whom or how many. A
contingency is simply an indeterminable future event, which may or may not be attended with danger or risk.
See ACCIDENT; DANGER.

assurance, necessity, protection, safety, surety. certainty, plan, safeguard, security,

HEALTHY.
Synonyms:
hale, hygienic, sanitary, vigorous, healthful, salubrious, sound, well, hearty, salutary, strong, wholesome.
Healthy is most correctly used to signify possessing or enjoying health or its results; as, a healthy person; a
healthy condition. Healthful signifies promotive of health, tending or adapted to confer, preserve, or promote
health; as, a healthful climate. Wholesome food in a healthful climate makes a healthy man. With healthful are
ranged the words hygienic, salubrious, salutary, sanitary, and wholesome, while the other words are
associated with healthy. Salubrious is always used in the physical sense, and is chiefly applied to air or
climate. Salutary is now chiefly used in the moral sense; as, a salutary lesson.
Antonyms:
delicate, failing, ill, unsound, worn, diseased, fainting, sick, wasted, worn down, emaciated, fragile, unhealthy,
weak, worn out. exhausted, frail,
* * * * *
HELP.
Synonyms:
abet, befriend, foster, succor, uphold. aid, cooperate, second, support, assist, encourage, stand by, sustain,
Help expresses greater dependence and deeper need than aid. In extremity we say "God help me!" rather than
"God aid me!" In time of danger we cry "help! help!" rather than "aid! aid!" To aid is to second another's own
exertions. We can speak of helping the helpless, but not of aiding them. Help includes aid, but aid may fall
short of the meaning of help. In law to aid or abet makes one a principal. (Compare synonyms for
ACCESSORY.) To cooperate is to aid as an equal; to assist implies a subordinate and secondary relation.
One assists a fallen friend to rise; he cooperates with him in helping others. Encourage refers to mental aid,
as uphold now usually does; succor and support, oftenest to material assistance. We encourage the timid or
despondent, succor the endangered, support the weak, uphold those who else might be shaken or cast down.
Compare ABET; PROMOTE.
Antonyms:
counteract, discourage, oppose, resist, thwart, withstand.
Prepositions:
Help in an enterprise with money; help to success; against the enemy.
* * * * *
HERETIC.
Synonyms:
dissenter, heresiarch, non-conformist, schismatic.
Etymologically, a heretic is one who takes or chooses his own belief, instead of the belief of his church;
hence, a heretic is one who denies commonly accepted views, or who holds opinions contrary to the
recognized standard or tenets of any established religious, philosophical, or other system, school, or party; the
religious sense of the word is the predominant one; a schismatic is primarily one who produces a split or rent
in the church. A heretic differs in doctrine from the religious body with which he is connected; a schismatic
differs in doctrine or practise, or in both. A heretic may be reticent, or even silent; a schismatic introduces
divisions. A heresiarch is the author of a heresy or the leader of a heretical party, and is thus at once a heretic
and a schismatic. With advancing ideas of religious liberty, the odious sense once attached to these words is
largely modified, and heretic is often used playfully. Dissenter and non-conformist are terms specifically
applied to English subjects who hold themselves aloof from the Church of England; the former term is
extended to non-adherents of the established church in some other countries, as Russia.
* * * * *
HETEROGENEOUS.
Synonyms:
confused, mingled, unhomogeneous, conglomerate, miscellaneous, unlike, discordant, mixed, variant,
dissimilar, non-homogeneous, various.
Substances quite unlike are heterogeneous as regards each other. A heterogeneous mixture is one whose
constituents are not only unlike in kind, but unevenly distributed; cement is composed of substances such as
lime, sand, and clay, which are heterogeneous as regards each other, but the cement is said to be
homogeneous if the different constituents are evenly mixed throughout, so that any one portion of the mixture
is exactly like any other. A substance may fail of being homogeneous and yet not be heterogeneous, in which
case it is said to be non-homogeneous or unhomogeneous; a bar of iron that contains flaws, air-bubbles, etc.,
or for any other reason is not of uniform structure and density throughout, tho no foreign substance be mixed
with the iron, is said to be non-homogeneous. A miscellaneous mixture may or may not be heterogeneous; if
the objects are alike in kind, but different in size, form, quality, use, etc., and without special order or relation,
the collection is miscellaneous; if the objects differ in kind, such a mixture is also, and more strictly,
heterogeneous; a pile of unassorted lumber is miscellaneous; the contents of a school-boy's pocket are
commonly miscellaneous and might usually be termed heterogeneous as well. See COMPLEX.
Antonyms:
alike, homogeneous, identical, like, pure, same, similar, uniform.

HIDE.
Synonyms:
bury, cover, entomb, overwhelm, suppress, cloak, disguise, inter, screen, veil. conceal, dissemble, mask,
secrete.
Hide is the general term, including all the rest, signifying to put out of sight or beyond ready observation or
approach; a thing may be hidden by intention, by accident, or by the imperfection of the faculties of the one
from whom it is hidden; in their games, children hide the slipper, or hide themselves from each other; a man
unconsciously hides a picture from another by standing before it, or hides a thing from himself by laying
something else over it. Even an unconscious object may hide another; as, a cloud hides the sun, or a building
hides some part of the prospect by intervening between it and the observer's position. As an act of persons, to
conceal is always intentional; one may hide his face in anger, grief, or abstraction; he conceals his face when
he fears recognition. A house is hidden by foliage; the bird's nest is artfully concealed. Secrete is a stronger
word than conceal, and is used chiefly of such material objects as may be separated from the person, or from
their ordinary surroundings, and put in unlooked-for places; a man conceals a scar on his face, but does not
secrete it; a thief secretes stolen goods; an officer may also be said to secrete himself to watch the thief. A
thing is covered by putting something over or around it, whether by accident or design; it is screened by
putting something before it, always with some purpose of protection from observation, inconvenience, attack,
censure, etc. In the figurative use, a person may hide honorable feelings; he conceals an evil or hostile intent.
Anything which is effectually covered and hidden under any mass or accumulation is buried. Money is buried
in the ground; a body is buried in the sea; a paper is buried under other documents. Whatever is buried is
hidden or concealed; but there are many ways of hiding or concealing a thing without burying it. So a person
may be covered with wraps, and not buried under them. Bury may be used of any object, entomb and inter
only of a dead body. Figuratively, one may be said to be buried in business, in study, etc. Compare
IMMERSE; PALLIATE.
Antonyms:
admit, disclose, exhume, manifest, show, advertise, discover, expose, promulgate, tell, avow, disinter, lay
bare, publish, uncover, betray, divulge, lay open, raise, unmask, confess, exhibit, make known, reveal, unveil.

HIGH.
Synonyms:
elevated, exalted, noble, steep, towering, eminent, lofty, proud, tall, uplifted.
Deep, while an antonym of high in usage, may apply to the very same distance simply measured in an
opposite direction, high applying to vertical distance measured from below upward, and deep to vertical
distance measured from above downward; as, a deep valley nestling between high mountains. High is a
relative term signifying greatly raised above any object, base, or surface, in comparison with what is usual, or
with some standard; a table is high if it exceeds thirty inches; a hill is not high at a hundred feet. That is tall
whose height is greatly in excess of its breadth or diameter, and whose actual height is great for an object of
its kind; as, a tall tree; a tall man; tall grass. That is lofty which is imposing or majestic in height; we term a
spire tall with reference to its altitude, or lofty with reference to its majestic appearance. That is elevated
which is raised somewhat above its surroundings; that is eminent which is far above them; as, an elevated
platform; an eminent promontory. In the figurative sense, elevated is less than eminent, and this less than
exalted; we speak of high, lofty, or elevated thoughts, aims, etc., in the good sense, but sometimes of high
feelings, looks, words, etc., in the invidious sense of haughty or arrogant. A high ambition may be merely
selfish; a lofty ambition is worthy and noble. Towering, in the literal sense compares with lofty and majestic;
but in the figurative sense, its use is almost always invidious; as, a towering passion; a towering ambition
disregards and crushes all opposing considerations, however rational, lovely, or holy. Compare STEEP.
Antonyms:
base, degraded, dwarfed, inferior, low, mean, short, stunted. deep, depressed,

HINDER.
Synonyms:
baffle, clog, foil, obstruct, retard, balk, counteract, frustrate, oppose, stay, bar, delay, hamper, prevent, stop,
block, embarrass, impede, resist, thwart. check, encumber, interrupt,
To hinder is to keep from action, progress, motion, or growth, or to make such action, progress, motion, or
growth later in beginning or completion than it would otherwise have been. An action is prevented by
anything that comes in before it to make it impossible; it is hindered by anything that keeps it from either
beginning or ending so soon as it otherwise would, or as expected or intended. It is more common, however,
to say that the start is delayed, the progress hindered. An action that is hindered does not take place at the
appointed or appropriate time; that which is prevented does not take place at all; to hinder a thing long enough
may amount to preventing it. A railroad-train may be hindered by a snow-storm from arriving on time; it may
by special order be prevented from starting. To retard is simply to make slow by any means whatever. To
obstruct is to hinder, or possibly to prevent advance or passage by putting something in the way; to oppose or
resist is to hinder, or possibly to prevent by directly contrary or hostile action, resist being the stronger term
and having more suggestion of physical force; obstructed roads hinder the march of an enemy, tho there may
be no force strong enough to oppose it; one opposes a measure, a motion, an amendment, or the like; it is a
criminal offense to resist an officer in the discharge of his duty; the physical system may resist the attack of
disease or the action of a remedy. Compare CONQUER; IMPEDIMENT; OBSTRUCT.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for QUICKEN.
Prepositions:
Hinder one in his progress; from acting promptly; by opposition.

HISTORY.
Synonyms:
account, biography, muniment, record, annals, chronicle, narration, register, archives, memoir, narrative,
story. autobiography, memorial, recital,
History is a systematic record of past events. Annals and chronicles relate events with little regard to their
relative importance, and with complete subserviency to their succession in time. Annals are yearly records;
chronicles follow the order of time. Both necessarily lack emphasis, selection, and perspective. Archives are
public records, which may be annals, or chronicles, or deeds of property, etc. Memoirs generally record the
lives of individuals or facts pertaining to individual lives. A biography is distinctively a written account of
one person's life and actions; an autobiography is a biography written by the person whose life it records.
Annals, archives, chronicles, biographies, and memoirs and other records furnish the materials of history.
History recounts events with careful attention to their importance, their mutual relations, their causes and
consequences, selecting and grouping events on the ground of interest or importance. History is usually
applied to such an account of events affecting communities and nations, tho sometimes we speak of the
history of a single eminent life. Compare RECORD.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for FICTION.
* * * * *
HOLY.
Synonyms:
blessed, devoted, hallowed, saintly, consecrated, divine, sacred, set apart.
Sacred is applied to that which is to be regarded as inviolable on any account, and so is not restricted to divine
things; therefore in its lower applications it is less than holy. That which is sacred may be made so by
institution, decree, or association; that which is holy is so by its own nature, possessing intrinsic moral purity,
and, in the highest sense, absolute moral perfection. God is holy; his commands are sacred. Holy may be
applied also to that which is hallowed; as, "the place whereon thou standest is holy ground," Ex. iii, 5. In such
use holy is more than sacred, as if the very qualities of a spiritual or divine presence were imparted to the
place or object. Divine has been used with great looseness, as applying to anything eminent or admirable, in
the line either of goodness or of mere power, as to eloquence, music, etc., but there is a commendable
tendency to restrict the word to its higher sense, as designating that which belongs to or is worthy of the
Divine Being. Compare PERFECT; PURE.
Antonyms:
abominable, cursed, polluted, unconsecrated, unholy, wicked, common, impure, secular, unhallowed,
unsanctified, worldly.
* * * * *
HOME.
Synonyms:
abode, dwelling, habitation, hearthstone, ingleside, domicil, fireside, hearth, house, residence.
Abode, dwelling, and habitation are used with little difference of meaning to denote the place where one
habitually lives; abode and habitation belong to the poetic or elevated style. Even dwelling is not used in
familiar speech; a person says "my house," "my home," or more formally "my residence." Home, from the
Anglo-Saxon, denoting originally a dwelling, came to mean an endeared dwelling as the scene of domestic
love and happy and cherished family life, a sense to which there is an increasing tendency to restrict the
word--desirably so, since we have other words to denote the mere dwelling-place; we say "The wretched
tenement could not be called home," or "The humble cabin was dear to him as the home of his childhood."
Home's not merely four square walls, Tho with pictures hung and gilded; Home is where affection calls--
Where its shrine the heart has builded.
Thus the word comes to signify any place of rest and peace, and especially heaven, as the soul's peaceful and
eternal dwelling-place.
* * * * *
HONEST.
Synonyms:
candid, frank, ingenuous, true, equitable, genuine, just, trustworthy, fair, good, sincere, trusty, faithful,
honorable, straightforward, upright.
One who is honest in the ordinary sense acts or is always disposed to act with careful regard for the rights of
others, especially in matters of business or property; one who is honorable scrupulously observes the dictates
of a personal honor that is higher than any demands of mercantile law or public opinion, and will do nothing
unworthy of his own inherent nobility of soul. The honest man does not steal, cheat, or defraud; the honorable
man will not take an unfair advantage that would be allowed him, or will make a sacrifice which no one could
require of him, when his own sense of right demands it. One who is honest in the highest and fullest sense is
scrupulously careful to adhere to all known truth and right even in thought. In this sense honest differs from
honorable as having regard rather to absolute truth and right than to even the highest personal honor. Compare
CANDID; JUSTICE.
Antonyms:
deceitful, faithless, hypocritical, perfidious, unfaithful, dishonest, false, lying, traitorous, unscrupulous,
disingenuous, fraudulent, mendacious, treacherous, untrue.
* * * * *
HORIZONTAL.
Synonyms:
even, flat, level, plain, plane.
Horizontal signifies in the direction of or parallel to the horizon. For practical purposes level and horizontal
are identical, tho level, as the more popular word, is more loosely used of that which has no especially
noticeable elevations or inequalities; as, a level road. Flat, according to its derivation from the Anglo-Saxon
flet, a floor, applies to a surface only, and, in the first and most usual sense, to a surface that is horizontal or
level in all directions; a line may be level, a floor is flat; flat is also applied in a derived sense to any plane
surface without irregularities or elevations, as a picture may be painted on the flat surface of a perpendicular
wall. Plane applies only to a surface, and is used with more mathematical exactness than flat. The adjective
plain, originally the same word as plane, is now rarely used except in the figurative senses, but the original
sense appears in the noun, as we speak of "a wide plain." We speak of a horizontal line, a flat morass, a level
road, a plain country, a plane surface (especially in the scientific sense). That which is level may not be even,
and that which is even may not be level; a level road may be very rough; a slope may be even.
Antonyms:
broken, inclined, rolling, rugged, sloping, hilly, irregular, rough, slanting, uneven.

HUMANE.
Synonyms:
benevolent, compassionate, human, pitying, benignant, forgiving, kind, sympathetic, charitable, gentle,
kind-hearted, tender, clement, gracious, merciful, tender-hearted.
Human denotes what pertains to mankind, with no suggestion as to its being good or evil; as, the human race;
human qualities; we speak of human achievements, virtues, or excellences, human follies, vices, or crimes.
Humane denotes what may rightly be expected of mankind at its best in the treatment of sentient beings; a
humane enterprise or endeavor is one that is intended to prevent or relieve suffering. The humane man will
not needlessly inflict pain upon the meanest thing that lives; a merciful man is disposed to withhold or
mitigate the suffering even of the guilty. The compassionate man sympathizes with and desires to relieve
actual suffering, while one who is humane would forestall and prevent the suffering which he sees to be
possible. Compare MERCY; PITIFUL; PITY.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for BARBAROUS.

HUNT.
Synonyms:
chase, hunting, inquisition, pursuit, search.
A hunt may be either the act of pursuing or the act of seeking, or a combination of the two. A chase or pursuit
is after that which is fleeing or departing; a search is for that which is hidden; a hunt may be for that which is
either hidden or fleeing; a search is a minute and careful seeking, and is especially applied to a locality; we
make a search of or through a house, for an object, in which connection it would be colloquial to say a hunt.
Hunt never quite loses its association with field-sports, where it includes both search and chase; the search till
the game is hunted out, and the chase till it is hunted down. Figuratively, we speak of literary pursuits, or of
the pursuit of knowledge; a search for reasons; the chase of fame or honor; hunt, in figurative use, inclines to
the unfavorable sense of inquisition, but with more of dash and aggressiveness; as, a hunt for heresy.
* * * * *
HYPOCRISY.
Synonyms:
affectation, formalism, pretense, sanctimony, cant, pharisaism, sanctimoniousness, sham. dissimulation,
pietism,
Pretense (L. prtendo) primarily signifies the holding something forward as having certain rights or claims,
whether truly or falsely; in the good sense, it is now rarely used except with a negative; as, there can be no
pretense that this is due; a false pretense implies the possibility of a true pretense; but, alone and unlimited,
pretense commonly signifies the offering of something for what it is not. Hypocrisy is the false pretense of
moral excellence, either as a cover for actual wrong, or for the sake of the credit and advantage attaching to
virtue. Cant (L. cantus, a song), primarily the singsong iteration of the language of any party, school, or sect,
denotes the mechanical and pretentious use of religious phraseology, without corresponding feeling or
character; sanctimoniousness is the assumption of a saintly manner without a saintly character. As cant is
hypocrisy in utterance, so sanctimoniousness is hypocrisy in appearance, as in looks, tones, etc. Pietism,
originally a word of good import, is now chiefly used for an unregulated emotionalism; formalism is an
exaggerated devotion to forms, rites, and ceremonies, without corresponding earnestness of heart; sham
(identical in origin with shame) is a trick or device that puts one to shame, or that shamefully disappoints
expectation or falsifies appearance. Affectation is in matters of intellect, taste, etc., much what hypocrisy is in
morals and religion; affectation might be termed petty hypocrisy. Compare DECEPTION.
Antonyms:
candor, genuineness, ingenuousness, sincerity, truth, frankness, honesty, openness, transparency, truthfulness.
* * * * *
HYPOCRITE.
Synonyms:
cheat, deceiver, dissembler, impostor, pretender.
A hypocrite (Gr. hypokrites, one who answers on the stage, an actor, especially a mimic actor) is one who acts
a false part, or assumes a character other than the real. Deceiver is the most comprehensive term, including all
the other words of the group. The deceiver seeks to give false impressions of any matter where he has an end
to gain; the dissembler or hypocrite seeks to give false impressions in regard to himself. The dissembler is
content if he can keep some base conduct or evil purpose from being discovered; the hypocrite seeks not
merely to cover his vices, but to gain credit for virtue. The cheat and impostor endeavor to make something
out of those they may deceive. The cheat is the inferior and more mercenary, as the thimble-rig gambler; the
impostor may aspire to a fortune or a throne. Compare HYPOCRISY.
Antonyms:
The antonyms of hypocrite are to be found only in phrases embodying the adjectives candid, honest,
ingenuous, sincere, true, etc.

HYPOTHESIS.
Synonyms:
conjecture, scheme, supposition, system, guess, speculation, surmise, theory.
A hypothesis is a statement of what is deemed possibly true, assumed and reasoned upon as if certainly true,
with a view of reaching truth not yet surely known; especially, in the sciences, a hypothesis is a
comprehensive tentative explanation of certain phenomena, which is meant to include all other facts of the
same class, and which is assumed as true till there has been opportunity to bring all related facts into
comparison; if the hypothesis explains all the facts, it is regarded as verified; till then it is regarded as a
working hypothesis, that is, one that may answer for present practical purposes. A hypothesis may be termed a
comprehensive guess. A guess is a swift conclusion from data directly at hand, and held as probable or
tentative, while one confessedly lacks material for absolute certainty. A conjecture is more methodical than a
guess, while a supposition is still slower and more settled; a conjecture, like a guess, is preliminary and
tentative; a supposition is more nearly final; a surmise is more floating and visionary, and often sinister; as, a
surmise that a stranger may be a pickpocket. Theory is used of the mental coordination of facts and principles,
that may or may not prove correct; a machine may be perfect in theory, but useless in fact. Scheme may be
used as nearly equivalent to theory, but is more frequently applied to proposed action, and in the sense of a
somewhat visionary plan. A speculation may be wholly of the brain, resting upon no facts worthy of
consideration; system is the highest of these terms, having most of assurance and fixity; a system unites many
facts, phenomena, or doctrines into an orderly and consistent whole; we speak of a system of theology, of the
Copernican system of the universe. Compare SYSTEM.
Antonyms:
certainty, demonstration, discovery, evidence, fact, proof.

IDEA.
Synonyms:
apprehension, design, impression, plan, archetype, fancy, judgment, purpose, belief, fantasy, model,
sentiment, conceit, ideal, notion, supposition, concept, image, opinion, theory, conception, imagination,
pattern, thought.
Idea is in Greek a form or an image. The word signified in early philosophical use the archetype or primal
image which the Platonic philosophy supposed to be the model or pattern that existing objects imperfectly
embody. This high sense has nearly disappeared from the word idea, and has been largely appropriated by
ideal, tho something of the original meaning still appears when in theological or philosophical language we
speak of the ideas of God. The present popular use of idea makes it to signify any product of mental
apprehension or activity, considered as an object of knowledge or thought; this coincides with the primitive
sense at but a single point--that an idea is mental as opposed to anything substantial or physical; thus, almost
any mental product, as a belief, conception, design, opinion, etc., may now be called an idea. Compare
FANCY; IDEAL.
Antonyms:
actuality, fact, reality, substance.
* * * * *
IDEAL.
Synonyms:
archetype, model, pattern, prototype, standard. idea, original,
An ideal is that which is conceived or taken as the highest type of excellence or ultimate object of attainment.
The archetype is the primal form, actual or imaginary, according to which any existing thing is constructed;
the prototype has or has had actual existence; in the derived sense, as in metrology, a prototype may not be the
original form, but one having equal authority with that as a standard. An ideal may be primal, or may be
slowly developed even from failures and by negations; an ideal is meant to be perfect, not merely the thing
that has been attained or is to be attained, but the best conceivable thing that could by possibility be attained.
The artist's ideal is his own mental image, of which his finished work is but an imperfect expression. The
original is the first specimen, good or bad; the original of a master is superior to all copies. The standard may
be below the ideal. The ideal is imaginary, and ordinarily unattainable; the standard is concrete, and
ordinarily attainable, being a measure to which all else of its kind must conform; as, the standard of weights
and measures, of corn, or of cotton. The idea of virtue is the mental concept or image of virtue in general; the
ideal of virtue is the mental concept or image of virtue in its highest conceivable perfection. Compare
EXAMPLE; IDEA.
Antonyms:
accomplishment, action, doing, fact, practise, achievement, attainment, embodiment, incarnation, reality, act,
development, execution, performance, realization.
* * * * *
IDIOCY.
Synonyms:
fatuity, foolishness, incapacity, stupidity. folly, imbecility, senselessness,
Idiocy is a state of mental unsoundness amounting almost or quite to total absence of understanding.
Imbecility is a condition of mental weakness, which may or may not be as complete as that of idiocy, but is at
least such as to incapacitate for the serious duties of life. Incapacity, or lack of legal qualification for certain
acts, necessarily results from imbecility, but may also result from other causes, as from insanity or from age,
sex, etc.; as, the incapacity of a minor to make a contract. Idiocy or imbecility is weakness of mind, while
insanity is disorder or abnormal action of mind. Folly and foolishness denote a want of mental and often of
moral balance. Fatuity is sometimes used as equivalent to idiocy, but more frequently signifies conceited and
excessive foolishness or folly. Stupidity is dulness and slowness of mental action which may range all the way
from lack of normal readiness to absolute imbecility. Compare INSANITY.
Antonyms:
acuteness, brilliancy, common sense, sagacity, soundness, astuteness, capacity, intelligence, sense, wisdom.
* * * * *
IDLE.
Synonyms:
inactive, inert, slothful, trifling, unoccupied, indolent, lazy, sluggish, unemployed, vacant.
Idle in all uses rests upon its root meaning, as derived from the Anglo-Saxon idel, which signifies vain,
empty, useless. Idle thus denotes not primarily the absence of action, but vain action--the absence of useful,
effective action; the idle schoolboy may be very actively whittling his desk or tormenting his neighbors.
Doing nothing whatever is the secondary meaning of idle. One may be temporarily idle of necessity; if he is
habitually idle, it is his own fault. Lazy signifies indisposed to exertion, averse to labor; idleness is in fact;
laziness is in disposition or inclination. A lazy person may chance to be employed in useful work, but he acts
without energy or impetus. We speak figuratively of a lazy stream. The inert person seems like dead matter
(characterized by inertia), powerless to move; the sluggish moves heavily and toilsomely; the most active
person may sometimes find the bodily or mental powers sluggish. Slothful belongs in the moral realm,
denoting a self-indulgent aversion to exertion. "The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
bring it again to his mouth," Prov. xxvi, 15. Indolent is a milder term for the same quality; the slothful man
hates action; the indolent man loves inaction. Compare VAIN.
Antonyms:
active, busy, diligent, employed, industrious, occupied, working.
* * * * *
IGNORANT.
Synonyms:
ill-informed, unenlightened, unlearned, untaught, illiterate, uninformed, unlettered, untutored. uneducated,
uninstructed, unskilled,
Ignorant signifies destitute of education or knowledge, or lacking knowledge or information; it is thus a
relative term. The most learned man is still ignorant of many things; persons are spoken of as ignorant who
have not the knowledge that has become generally diffused in the world; the ignorant savage may be well
instructed in matters of the field and the chase, and is thus more properly untutored than ignorant. Illiterate is
without letters and the knowledge that comes through reading. Unlettered is similar in meaning to illiterate,
but less absolute; the unlettered man may have acquired the art of reading and writing and some elementary
knowledge; the uneducated man has never taken any systematic course of mental training. Ignorance is
relative; illiteracy is absolute; we have statistics of illiteracy; no statistics of ignorance are possible.
Antonyms:
educated, learned, sage, skilled, trained, well-informed, wise. instructed,
* * * * *
IMAGINATION.
Synonyms:
fancy, fantasy, phantasy.
The old psychology treated of the Reproductive Imagination, which simply reproduces the images that the
mind has in any way acquired, and the Productive Imagination which modifies and combines mental images
so as to produce what is virtually new. To this Reproductive Imagination President Noah Porter and others
have given the name of phantasy or fantasy (many psychologists preferring the former spelling). Phantasy or
fantasy, so understood, presents numerous and varied images, often combining them into new forms with
exceeding vividness, yet without any true constructive power, but with the mind adrift, blindly and passively
following the laws of association, and with reason and will in torpor; the mental images being perhaps as
varied and as vivid, but also as purposeless and unsystematized as the visual images in a kaleidoscope; such
fantasy (often loosely called imagination) appears in dreaming, reverie, somnambulism, and intoxication.
Fantasy in ordinary usage simply denotes capricious or erratic fancy, as appears in the adjective fantastic.
Imagination and fancy differ from fantasy in bringing the images and their combinations under the control of
the will; imagination is the broader and higher term, including fancy; imagination is the act or power of
imaging or of reimaging objects of perception or thought, of combining the products of knowledge in
modified, new, or ideal forms--the creative or constructive power of the mind; while fancy is the act or power
of forming pleasing, graceful, whimsical, or odd mental images, or of combining them with little regard to
rational processes of construction; imagination in its lower form. Both fancy and imagination recombine and
modify mental images; either may work with the other's materials; imagination may glorify the tiniest flower;
fancy may play around a mountain or a star; the one great distinction between them is that fancy is superficial,
while imagination is deep, essential, spiritual. Wordsworth, who was the first clearly to draw the distinction
between the fancy and the imagination, states it as follows:
To aggregate and to associate, to evoke and to combine, belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy; but
either the materials evoked and combined are different; or they are brought together under a different law, and
for a different purpose. Fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be
susceptible of changes in their constitution from her touch; and where they admit of modification, it is enough
for her purpose if it be slight, limited, and evanescent. Directly the reverse of these are the desires and
demands of the imagination. She recoils from everything but the plastic, the pliant, and the indefinite. She
leaves it to fancy to describe Queen Mab as coming:
'In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman.'
Having to speak of stature, she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as Pompey's Pillar; much
less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high; or that his dimensions equalled those of
Teneriffe or Atlas; because these, and if they were a million times as high, it would be the same, are bounded.
The expression is, 'His stature reached the sky!' the illimitable firmament!--When the imagination frames a
comparison, ... a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows--and continues
to grow--upon the mind; the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon
expression and effect, less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties.[B]
Poetical Works, Pref. to Ed. of 1815, p. 646, app. [T. & H. '51.]
So far as actual images are concerned, both fancy and imagination are limited to the materials furnished by the
external world; it is remarkable that among all the representations of gods or demigods, fiends and demons,
griffins and chimras, the human mind has never invented one organ or attribute that is not presented in
human or animal life; the lion may have a human head and an eagle's wings and claws, but in the various
features, individually, there is absolutely nothing new. But imagination can transcend the work of fancy, and
compare an image drawn from the external world with some spiritual truth born in the mind itself, or infuse a
series of images with such a spiritual truth, molding them as needed for its more vivid expression.
The imagination modifies images, and gives unity to variety; it sees all things in one.... There is the epic
imagination, the perfection of which is in Milton; and the dramatic, of which Shakspeare is the absolute
master.
COLERIDGE Table Talk June 23, '34.
Fancy keeps the material image prominent and clear, and works not only with it, but for it; imagination
always uses the material object as the minister of something greater than itself, and often almost loses the
object in the spiritual idea with which she has associated it, and for which alone she values it. Fancy flits
about the surface, and is airy and playful, sometimes petty and sometimes false; imagination goes to the heart
of things, and is deep, earnest, serious, and seeks always and everywhere for essential truth. Fancy sets off,
variegates, and decorates; imagination transforms and exalts. Fancy delights and entertains; imagination
moves and thrills. Imagination is not only poetic or literary, but scientific, philosophical, and practical. By
imagination the architect sees the unity of a building not yet begun, and the inventor sees the unity and varied
interactions of a machine never yet constructed, even a unity that no human eye ever can see, since when the
machine is in actual motion, one part may hide the connecting parts, and yet all keep the unity of the
inventor's thought. By imagination a Newton sweeps sun, planets, and stars into unity with the earth and the
apple that is drawn irresistibly to its surface, and sees them all within the circle of one grand law. Science,
philosophy, and mechanical invention have little use for fancy, but the creative, penetrative power of
imagination is to them the breath of life, and the condition of all advance and success. See also FANCY;
IDEA.

IMMEDIATELY.
Synonyms:
at once, instanter, presently, straightway, directly, instantly, right away, this instant, forthwith, now, right off,
without delay.
The strong and general human tendency to procrastination is shown in the progressive weakening of the
various words in this group. Immediately primarily signifies without the intervention of anything as a medium,
hence without the intervention of any, even the briefest, interval or lapse of time. By and by, which was once a
synonym, has become an antonym of immediately, meaning at some (perhaps remote) future time. Directly,
which once meant with no intervening time, now means after some little while; presently no longer means in
this very present, but before very long. Even immediately is sliding from its instantaneousness, so that we are
fain to substitute at once, instantly, etc., when we would make promptness emphatic. Right away and right off
are vigorous conversational expressions in the United States.
Antonyms:
after a while, by and by, hereafter, in the future, some time.
* * * * *
IMMERSE.
Synonyms:
bury, dip, douse, duck, immerge, plunge, sink, submerge.
Dip is Saxon, while immerse is Latin for the same initial act; dip is accordingly the more popular and
commonplace, immerse the more elegant and dignified expression in many cases. To speak of baptism by
immersion as dipping now seems rude; tho entirely proper and usual in early English. Baptists now
universally use the word immerse. To dip and to immerse alike signify to bury or submerge some object in a
liquid; but dip implies that the object dipped is at once removed from the liquid, while immerse is wholly
silent as to the removal. Immerse also suggests more absolute completeness of the action; one may dip his
sleeve or dip a sponge in a liquid, if he but touches the edge; if he immerses it, he completely sinks it under,
and covers it with the liquid. Submerge implies that the object can not readily be removed, if at all; as, a
submerged wreck. To plunge is to immerse suddenly and violently, for which douse and duck are colloquial
terms. Dip is used, also, unlike the other words, to denote the putting of a hollow vessel into a liquid in order
to remove a portion of it; in this sense we say dip up, dip out. Compare synonyms for BURY.
Preposition:
The object is immersed in water.
* * * * *
IMMINENT.
Synonyms:
impending, threatening.
Imminent, from the Latin, with the sense of projecting over, signifies liable to happen at once, as some
calamity, dangerous and close at hand. Impending, also from the Latin, with the sense of hanging over, is
closely akin to imminent, but somewhat less emphatic. Imminent is more immediate, impending more remote,
threatening more contingent. An impending evil is almost sure to happen at some uncertain time, perhaps very
near; an imminent peril is one liable to befall very speedily; a threatening peril may be near or remote, but
always with hope that it may be averted.
Antonyms:
chimerical, doubtful, problematical, unexpected, unlikely. contingent, improbable,
* * * * *
IMPEDIMENT.
Synonyms:
bar, clog, encumbrance, obstacle, barrier, difficulty, hindrance, obstruction.
Difficulty makes an undertaking otherwise than easy. That which rests upon one as a burden is an
encumbrance. An impediment is primarily something that checks the foot or in any way makes advance slow
or difficult; an obstacle is something that stands across the way, an obstruction something that is built or
placed across the way. An obstruction is always an obstacle, but an obstacle may not always be properly
termed an obstruction; boxes and bales placed on the sidewalk are obstructions to travel; an ice-floe is an
obstacle to navigation, and may become an obstruction if it closes an inlet or channel. A hindrance (kindred
with hind, behind) is anything that makes one come behind or short of his purpose. An impediment may be
either what one finds in his way or what he carries with him; impedimenta was the Latin name for the baggage
of a soldier or of an army. The tendency is to view an impediment as something constant or, at least for a time,
continuous; as, an impediment in one's speech. A difficulty or a hindrance may be either within one or
without; a speaker may find difficulty in expressing himself, or difficulty in holding the attention of restless
children. An encumbrance is always what one carries with him; an obstacle or an obstruction is always
without. To a marching soldier the steepness of a mountain path is a difficulty, loose stones are impediments, a
fence is an obstruction, a cliff or a boulder across the way is an obstacle; a knapsack is an encumbrance.
Antonyms:
advantage, aid, assistance, benefit, help, relief, succor.
* * * * *
IMPUDENCE.
Synonyms:
assurance, impertinence, intrusiveness, presumption, boldness, incivility, officiousness, rudeness, effrontery,
insolence, pertness, sauciness. forwardness,
Impertinence primarily denotes what does not pertain or belong to the occasion or the person, and hence
comes to signify interference by word or act not consistent with the age, position, or relation of the person
interfered with or of the one who interferes; especially, forward, presumptuous, or meddlesome speech.
Impudence is shameless impertinence. What would be arrogance in a superior becomes impertinence or
impudence in an inferior. Impertinence has less of intent and determination than impudence. We speak of
thoughtless impertinence, shameless impudence. Insolence is literally that which is against custom, i. e., the
violation of customary respect and courtesy. Officiousness is thrusting upon others unasked and undesired
service, and is often as well-meant as it is annoying. Rudeness is the behavior that might be expected from a
thoroughly uncultured person, and may be either deliberate and insulting or unintentional and even
unconscious. Compare ARROGANCE; ASSURANCE; EFFRONTERY; PERTNESS.
Antonyms:
bashfulness, diffidence, lowliness, modesty, coyness, humility, meekness, submissiveness.
Prepositions:
The impudence of, or impudence from, a subordinate to a superior.
* * * * *
INCONGRUOUS.
Synonyms:
absurd, ill-matched, inharmonious, conflicting, inapposite, irreconcilable, contradictory, inappropriate,
mismatched, contrary, incommensurable, mismated, discordant, incompatible, repugnant, discrepant,
inconsistent, unsuitable.
Two or more things that do not fit well together, or are not adapted to each other, are said to be incongruous; a
thing is said to be incongruous that is not adapted to the time, place, or occasion; the term is also applied to a
thing made up of ill-assorted parts or inharmonious elements. Discordant is applied to all things that jar in
association like musical notes that are not in accord; inharmonious has the same original sense, but is a milder
term. Incompatible primarily signifies unable to sympathize or feel alike; inconsistent means unable to stand
together. Things are incompatible which can not exist together in harmonious relations, and whose action
when associated tends to ultimate extinction of one by the other. Inconsistent applies to things that can not be
made to agree in thought with each other, or with some standard of truth or right; slavery and freedom are
inconsistent with each other in theory, and incompatible in fact. Incongruous applies to relations, unsuitable
to purpose or use; two colors are incongruous which can not be agreeably associated; either may be unsuitable
for a person, a room, or an occasion. Incommensurable is a mathematical term, applying to two or more
quantities that have no common measure or aliquot part.
Antonyms:
accordant, agreeing, compatible, consistent, harmonious, suitable.
Preposition:
The illustrations were incongruous with the theme.
* * * * *
INDUCTION.
Synonyms:
deduction, inference.
Deduction is reasoning from the general to the particular; induction is reasoning from the particular to the
general. Deduction proceeds from a general principle through an admitted instance to a conclusion. Induction,
on the other hand, proceeds from a number of collated instances, through some attribute common to them all,
to a general principle. The proof of an induction is by using its conclusion as the premise of a new deduction.
Thus what is ordinarily known as scientific induction is a constant interchange of induction and deduction. In
deduction, if the general rule is true, and the special case falls under the rule, the conclusion is certain;
induction can ordinarily give no more than a probable conclusion, because we can never be sure that we have
collated all instances. An induction is of the nature of an inference, but while an inference may be partial and
hasty, an induction is careful, and aims to be complete. Compare DEMONSTRATION; HYPOTHESIS.
* * * * *
INDUSTRIOUS.
Synonyms:
active, busy, employed, occupied, assiduous, diligent, engaged, sedulous.
Industrious signifies zealously or habitually applying oneself to any work or business. Busy applies to an
activity which may be temporary, industrious to a habit of life. We say a man is busy just now; that is,
occupied at the moment with something that takes his full attention. It would be ridiculous or satirical to say,
he is industrious just now. But busy can be used in the sense of industrious, as when we say he is a busy man.
Diligent indicates also a disposition, which is ordinarily habitual, and suggests more of heartiness and volition
than industrious. We say one is a diligent, rather than an industrious, reader of the Bible. In the use of the
nouns, we speak of plodding industry, but not of plodding diligence. Compare ACTIVE; INDUSTRY.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for IDLE.
* * * * *
INDUSTRY.
Synonyms:
application, diligence, labor, persistence, assiduity, effort, pains, sedulousness. attention, exertion, patience,
constancy, intentness, perseverance,
Industry is the quality, action, or habit of earnest, steady, and continued attention or devotion to any useful or
productive work or task, manual or mental. Assiduity (L. ad, to, and sedeo, sit), as the etymology suggests, sits
down to a task until it is done. Diligence (L. diligo, love, choose) invests more effort and exertion, with love
of the work or deep interest in its accomplishment; application (L. ad, to, and plico, fold) bends to its work
and concentrates all one's powers upon it with utmost intensity; hence, application can hardly be as
unremitting as assiduity. Constancy is a steady devotion of heart and principle. Patience works on in spite of
annoyances; perseverance overcomes hindrances and difficulties; persistence strives relentlessly against
opposition; persistence has very frequently an unfavorable meaning, implying that one persists in spite of
considerations that should induce him to desist. Industry is diligence applied to some avocation, business, or
profession. Labor and pains refer to the exertions of the worker and the tax upon him, while assiduity,
perseverance, etc., refer to his continuance in the work.
Antonyms:
changeableness, idleness, inconstancy, neglect, remissness, fickleness, inattention, indolence, negligence,
sloth.
* * * * *
INFINITE.
Synonyms:
absolute, illimitable, limitless, unconditioned, boundless, immeasurable, measureless, unfathomable,
countless, innumerable, numberless, unlimited, eternal, interminable, unbounded, unmeasured.
Infinite (L. in, not, and finis, limit) signifies without bounds or limits in any way, and may be applied to space,
time, quantity, or number. Countless, innumerable, and numberless, which should be the same as infinite, are
in common usage vaguely employed to denote what it is difficult or practically impossible to count or
number, tho perhaps falling far short of infinite; as, countless leaves, the countless sands on the seashore,
numberless battles, innumerable delays. So, too, boundless, illimitable, limitless, measureless, and unlimited
are loosely used in reference to what has no apparent or readily determinable limits in space or time; as, we
speak of the boundless ocean. Infinite space is without bounds, not only in fact, but in thought; infinite time is
truly eternal. Compare synonyms for ETERNAL.
Antonyms:
bounded, finite, measurable, restricted, small, brief, limited, moderate, shallow, transient, circumscribed, little,
narrow, short, transitory. evanescent,
* * * * *
INFLUENCE.
Synonyms:
actuate, draw, impel, induce, move, stir, compel, drive, incite, instigate, persuade, sway, dispose, excite,
incline, lead, prompt, urge.
To influence (L. in, in or into, and fluo, flow) is to affect, modify, or act upon by physical, mental, or moral
power, especially in some gentle, subtle, and gradual way; as, vegetation is influenced by light; every one is
influenced to some extent by public opinion; influence is chiefly used of power acting from without, tho it
may be used of motives regarded as forces acting upon the will. Actuate refers solely to mental or moral
power impelling one from within. One may influence, but can not directly actuate another; but one may be
actuated to cruelty by hatred which another's misrepresentation has aroused. Prompt and stir are words of
mere suggestion toward some course of action; dispose, draw, incline, influence, and lead refer to the use of
mild means to awaken in another a purpose or disposition to act. To excite is to arouse one from lethargy or
indifference to action. Incite and instigate, to spur or goad one to action, differ in the fact that incite may be to
good, while instigate is always to evil (compare ABET). To urge and impel signify to produce strong
excitation toward some act. We are urged from without, impelled from within. Drive and compel imply
irresistible influence accomplishing its object. One may be driven either by his own passions or by external
force or urgency; one is compelled only by some external power; as, the owner was compelled by his
misfortunes to sell his estate. Compare COMPEL; DRIVE.
Antonyms:
deter, dissuade, impede, prevent, restrain, retard. discourage, hinder, inhibit,
Prepositions:
Actuated to crime by revenge.

INHERENT.
Synonyms:
congenital, indispensable, innate, native, essential, indwelling, inseparable, natural, immanent, infixed,
internal, subjective. inborn, ingrained, intrinsic, inbred, inhering, inwrought,
Inherent signifies permanently united as an element or original quality, naturally existent or incorporated in
something so as to have become an integral part. Immanent is a philosophic word, to denote that which dwells
in or pervades any substance or spirit without necessarily being a part of it, and without reference to any
working out (compare SUBJECTIVE). That which is inherent is an inseparable part of that in which it
inheres, and is usually thought of with reference to some outworking or effect; as, an inherent difficulty. God
is said to be immanent (not inherent) in the universe. Frequently intrinsic and inherent can be interchanged,
but inherent applies to qualities, while intrinsic applies to essence, so that to speak of intrinsic excellence
conveys higher praise than if we say inherent excellence. Inherent and intrinsic may be said of persons or
things; congenital, inborn, inbred, innate, apply to living beings. Congenital is frequent in medical and legal
use with special application to defects; as, congenital idiocy. Innate and inborn are almost identical, but
innate is preferred in philosophic use, as when we speak of innate ideas; that which is inborn, congenital, or
innate may be original with the individual, but that which is inbred is inherited. Ingrained signifies dyed in
the grain, and denotes that which is deeply wrought into substance or character.

INJURY.
Synonyms:
blemish, disadvantage, hurt, loss, prejudice, damage, evil, impairment, mischief, wrong. detriment, harm,
injustice, outrage,
Injury (L. in, not, and jus, juris, right, law) signifies primarily something done contrary to law or right; hence,
something contrary to some standard of right or good; whatever reduces the value, utility, beauty, or
desirableness of anything is an injury to that thing; of persons, whatever is so done as to operate adversely to
one in his person, rights, property, or reputation is an injury; the word is especially used of whatever mars the
integrity of the body or causes pain; as, when rescued from the wreck his injuries were found to be very slight.
Injury is the general term including all the rest. Damage (L. damnum, loss) is that which occasions loss to the
possessor; hence, any impairment of value, often with the suggestion of fault on the part of the one causing it;
damage reduces value, utility, or beauty; detriment (L. deterere, to rub or wear away) is similar in meaning,
but far milder. Detriment may affect value only; damage always affects real worth or utility; as a rule, the
slightest use of an article by a purchaser operates to its detriment if again offered for sale, tho the article may
have received not the slightest damage. Damage is partial; loss is properly absolute as far as it is predicated at
all; the loss of a ship implies that it is gone beyond recovery; the loss of the rudder is a damage to the ship;
but since the loss of a part still leaves a part, we may speak of a partial or a total loss. Evil commonly suggests
suffering or sin, or both; as, the evils of poverty, the social evil. Harm is closely synonymous with injury; it
may apply to body, mind, or estate, but always affects real worth, while injury may concern only estimated
value. A hurt is an injury that causes pain, physical or mental; a slight hurt may be no real harm. Mischief is
disarrangement, trouble, or harm usually caused by some voluntary agent, with or without injurious intent; a
child's thoughtless sport may do great mischief; wrong is harm done with evil intent. An outrage combines
insult and injury. Compare synonyms for BLEMISH; CRIMINAL; INJUSTICE.
Antonyms:
advantage, benefit, boon, improvement, service, amelioration, blessing, help, remedy, utility.
Prepositions:
The injury of the cause; an injury to the structure; injury by fire; by or from collision, interference, etc.
* * * * *
INJUSTICE.
Synonyms:
grievance, injury, unfairness, unrighteousness, wrong. iniquity,
Injustice is a violation or denial of justice, an act or omission that is contrary to equity or justice; as, the
injustice of unequal taxes. In legal usage a wrong involves injury to person, property, or reputation, as the
result of evil intent; injustice applies to civil damage or loss, not necessarily involving injury to person or
property, as by misrepresentation of goods which does not amount to a legal warranty. In popular usage,
injustice may involve no direct injury to person, property, interest, or character, and no harmful intent, while
wrong always involves both; one who attributes another's truly generous act to a selfish motive does him an
injustice. Iniquity, in the original sense, is a want of or a deviation from equity; but it is now applied in the
widest sense to any form of ill-doing. Compare synonyms for CRIMINAL; SIN.
Antonyms:
equity, faithfulness, impartiality, lawfulness, righteousness, fairness, honesty, integrity, rectitude, uprightness.
fair play, honor, justice, right,

INNOCENT.
Synonyms:
blameless, guiltless, inoffensive, spotless, clean, harmless, pure, stainless, clear, immaculate, right, upright,
faultless, innocuous, righteous, virtuous. guileless, innoxious, sinless,
Innocent, in the full sense, signifies not tainted with sin; not having done wrong or violated legal or moral
precept or duty; as, an innocent babe. Innocent is a negative word, expressing less than righteous, upright, or
virtuous, which imply knowledge of good and evil, with free choice of the good. A little child or a lamb is
innocent; a tried and faithful man is righteous, upright, virtuous. Immaculate, pure, and sinless may be used
either of one who has never known the possibility of evil or of one who has perfectly and triumphantly
resisted it. Innocent is used of inanimate substances in the sense of harmless; as, an innocent remedy, that is,
one not dangerous, even if not helpful. Innocent, in a specific case, signifies free from the guilt of a particular
act, even tho the total character may be very evil; as, the thief was found to be innocent of the murder. See
CANDID; PURE.

INQUISITIVE.
Synonyms:
curious, meddlesome, peeping, scrutinizing, inquiring, meddling, prying, searching. intrusive,
An inquisitive person is one who is bent on finding out all that can be found out by inquiry, especially of little
and personal matters, and hence is generally meddlesome and prying. Inquisitive may be used in a good sense,
tho in such connection inquiring is to be preferred; as, an inquiring mind. As applied to a state of mind,
curious denotes a keen and rather pleasurable desire to know fully something to which one's attention has
been called, but without the active tendency that inquisitive implies; a well-bred person may be curious to
know, but will not be inquisitive in trying to ascertain, what is of interest in the affairs of another.
Antonyms:
apathetic, heedless, indifferent, unconcerned, uninterested. careless, inattentive,
Prepositions:
Inquisitive about, concerning, in regard to, regarding trifles.
* * * * *
INSANITY.
Synonyms:
aberration, delirium, frenzy, madness, alienation, dementia, hallucination, mania, craziness, derangement,
lunacy, monomania.
Of these terms insanity is the most exact and comprehensive, including in its widest sense all morbid
conditions of mind due to diseased action of the brain or nervous system, but in its more frequent restricted
use applied to those forms in which the mental disorder is persistent, as distinguished from those in which it is
temporary or transient. Craziness is a vague popular term for any sort of disordered mental action, or for
conduct suggesting it. Lunacy originally denoted intermittent insanity, supposed to be dependent on the
changes of the moon (L. luna): the term is now applied in general and legal use to any form of mental
unsoundness except idiocy. Madness is the old popular term, now less common, for insanity in its widest
sense, but with suggestion of excitement, akin to mania. In the derived sense, lunacy denotes what is insanely
foolish, madness what is insanely desperate. Derangement is a common euphemism for insanity. Delirium is
always temporary, and is specifically the insanity of disease, as in acute fevers. Dementia is a general
weakening of the mental powers: the word is specifically applied to senile insanity, dotage. Aberration is
eccentricity of mental action due to an abnormal state of the perceptive faculties, and is manifested by error in
perceptions and rambling thought. Hallucination is the apparent perception of that which does not exist or is
not present to the senses, as the seeing of specters or of reptiles in delirium tremens. Monomania is mental
derangement as to one subject or object. Frenzy and mania are forms of raving and furious insanity. Compare
synonyms for DELUSION; IDIOCY.
Antonyms:
clearness, good sense, lucidity, rationality, sanity.

INTERPOSE.
Synonyms:
arbitrate, intercept, intermeddle, meddle, intercede, interfere, interrupt, mediate.
To interpose is to place or come between other things or persons, usually as a means of obstruction or
prevention of some effect or result that would otherwise occur, or be expected to take place. Intercede and
interpose are used in a good sense; intermeddle always in a bad sense, and interfere frequently so. To
intercede is to come between persons who are at variance, and plead with the stronger in behalf of the weaker.
One may interpose with authority; he intercedes by petition. To intermeddle is to thrust oneself into the
concerns of others with a petty officiousness; meddling commonly arises from idle curiosity; "every fool will
be meddling," Prov. xx, 3; to interfere is to intrude into others' affairs with more serious purpose, with or
without acknowledged right or propriety. Intercept is applied to an object that may be seized or stopped while
in transit; as, to intercept a letter or a messenger; interrupt is applied to an action which might or should be
continuous, but is broken in upon (L. rumpere, to break) by some disturbing power; as, the conversation was
interrupted. One who arbitrates or mediates must do so by the request or at least with the consent of the
contending parties; the other words of the group imply that he steps in of his own accord.
Antonyms:
avoid, keep aloof, keep out, retire, stand back, hold aloof, keep away, let alone, stand aside, stand off, hold
off, keep clear, let be, stand away, withdraw.
Prepositions:
Interpose between the combatants; in the matter.
* * * * *
INVOLVE.
Synonyms:
complicate, embroil, implicate, include, embarrass, entangle, imply, overwhelm.
To involve (L. in, in, and volvo, roll) is to roll or wind up with or in so as to combine inextricably or
inseparably, or nearly so; as, the nation is involved in war; the bookkeeper's accounts, or the writer's sentences
are involved. Involve is a stronger word than implicate, denoting more complete entanglement. As applied to
persons, implicate is always used in an unfavorable sense, and involve ordinarily so; but implicate applies only
to that which is wrong, while involve is more commonly used of that which is unfortunate; one is implicated
in a crime, involved in embarrassments, misfortunes, or perplexities. As regards logical connection that which
is included is usually expressly stated; that which is implied is not stated, but is naturally to be inferred; that
which is involved is necessarily to be inferred; as, a slate roof is included in the contract; that the roof shall be
water-tight is implied; the contrary supposition involves an absurdity. See COMPLEX.
Antonyms:
disconnect, distinguish, explicate, extricate, remove, separate. disentangle,
* * * * *
JOURNEY.
Synonyms:
excursion, pilgrimage, transit, trip, expedition, tour, travel, voyage.
A journey (F. journe, from L. diurnus, daily) was primarily a day's work; hence, a movement from place to
place within one day, which we now describe as "a day's journey;" in its extended modern use a journey is a
direct going from a starting-point to a destination, ordinarily over a considerable distance; we speak of a day's
journey, or the journey of life. Travel is a passing from place to place, not necessarily in a direct line or with
fixed destination; a journey through Europe would be a passage to some destination beyond or at the farther
boundary; travel in Europe may be in no direct course, but may include many journeys in different directions.
A voyage, which was formerly a journey of any kind, is now a going to a considerable distance by water,
especially by sea; as, a voyage to India. A trip is a short and direct journey. A tour is a journey that returns to
the starting-point, generally over a considerable distance; as, a bridal tour, or business tour. An excursion is a
brief tour or journey, taken for pleasure, often by many persons at once; as, an excursion to Chautauqua.
Passage is a general word for a journey by any conveyance, especially by water; as, a rough passage across
the Atlantic; transit, literally the act of passing over or through, is used specifically of the conveyance of
passengers or merchandise; rapid transit is demanded for suburban residents or perishable goods. Pilgrimage,
once always of a sacred character, retains in derived uses something of that sense; as, a pilgrimage to
Stratford-on-Avon.
Prepositions:
A journey from Naples to Rome; through Mexico; across the continent; over the sea; a journey into Asia;
among savages; by land, by rail, for health, on foot, on the cars, etc.
* * * * *
JUDGE.
Synonyms:
arbiter, arbitrator, justice, referee, umpire.
A judge, in the legal sense, is a judicial officer appointed or elected to preside in courts of law, and to decide
legal questions duly brought before him; the name is sometimes given to other legally constituted officers; as,
the judges of election; in other relations, any person duly appointed to pass upon the merits of contestants or
of competing articles may be called a judge; as, the judges at an agricultural fair, or at a race-track; in the
widest sense, any person who has good capacity for judging is called a judge; as, a person is said to be a judge
of pictures, or a good judge of a horse, etc. In most games the judge is called an umpire; as, the umpire of a
game of ball or cricket. A referee is appointed by a court to decide disputed matters between litigants; an
arbitrator is chosen by the contending parties to decide matters in dispute without action by a court. In certain
cases an umpire is appointed by a court to decide where arbitrators disagree. Arbiter, with its suggestion of
final and absolute decision, has come to be used only in a high or sacred sense; as, war must now be the
arbiter; the Supreme Arbiter of our destinies. The judges of certain courts, as the United States Supreme
Court, are technically known as justices.

JUSTICE.
Synonyms:
equity, impartiality, legality, rightfulness, fairness, integrity, rectitude, truth, fair play, justness, right,
uprightness, faithfulness, law, righteousness, virtue. honor, lawfulness,
In its governmental relations, human or divine, justice is the giving to every person exactly what he deserves,
not necessarily involving any consideration of what any other may deserve; equity (the quality of being equal)
is giving every one as much advantage, privilege, or consideration as is given to any other; it is that which is
equally right or just to all concerned; equity is equal justice and is thus a close synonym for fairness and
impartiality, but it has a philosophical and legal precision that those words have not. In legal proceedings
cases arise for which the law has not adequately provided, or in which general provisions, just in the main,
would work individual hardship. The system of equity, devised to supply the insufficiencies of law, deals with
cases "to which the law by reason of its universality can not apply." "Equity, then, ... is the soul and spirit of
all law; positive law is construed and rational law is made by it." BLACKSTONE bk. iii, ch. 27, p. 429. In
personal and social relations justice is the rendering to every one what is due or merited, whether in act, word,
or thought; in matters of reasoning, or literary work of any kind, justice is close, faithful, unprejudiced, and
unbiased adherence to essential truth or fact; we speak of the justice of a statement, or of doing justice to a
subject. Integrity, rectitude, right, righteousness and virtue denote conformity of personal conduct to the
moral law, and thus necessarily include justice, which is giving others that which is their due. Lawfulness is an
ambiguous word, meaning in its narrower sense mere legality, which may be very far from justice, but in its
higher sense signifying accordance with the supreme law of right, and thus including perfect justice. Justness
refers rather to logical relations than to practical matters; as, we speak of the justness of a statement or of a
criticism. See JUDGE, n.
Antonyms:
dishonesty, inequity, partiality, unlawfulness, untruth, favoritism, injustice, unfairness, unreasonableness,
wrong.
Prepositions:
The justice of the king; to or for the oppressed.

KEEP.
Synonyms:
carry, defend, hold, preserve, retain, carry on, detain, maintain, protect, support, celebrate, fulfil, obey, refrain,
sustain, conduct, guard, observe, restrain, withhold.
Keep, signifying generally to have and retain in possession, is the terse, strong Saxon term for many acts
which are more exactly discriminated by other words. We keep, observe, or celebrate a festival; we keep or
hold a prisoner in custody; we keep or preserve silence, keep the peace, preserve order--preserve being the
more formal word; we keep or maintain a horse, a servant, etc.; a man supports his family; we keep or obey a
commandment; keep or fulfil a promise. In the expressions to keep a secret, keep one's own counsel, keep
faith, or keep the faith, such words as preserve or maintain could not be substituted without loss. A person
keeps a shop or store, conducts or carries on a business; he keeps or carries a certain line of goods; we may
keep or restrain one from folly, crime, or violence; we keep from or refrain from evil, ourselves. Keep in the
sense of guard or defend implies that the defense is effectual. Compare CELEBRATE; RESTRAIN.
Prepositions:
Keep in hand, in mind, in or within the house; from evil; out of mischief; keep to the subject; keep for a
person, an occasion, etc.
* * * * *
KILL.
Synonyms:
assassinate, despatch, massacre, put to death, slay. butcher, execute, murder, slaughter,
To kill is simply to deprive of life, human, animal, or vegetable, with no suggestion of how or why.
Assassinate, execute, murder, apply only to the taking of human life; to murder is to kill with premeditation
and malicious intent; to execute is to kill in fulfilment of a legal sentence; to assassinate is to kill by assault;
this word is chiefly applied to the killing of public or eminent persons through alleged political motives,
whether secretly or openly. To slay is to kill by a blow, or by a weapon. Butcher and slaughter apply primarily
to the killing of cattle; massacre is applied primarily and almost exclusively to human beings, signifying to
kill them indiscriminately in large numbers; to massacre is said when there is no chance of successful
resistance; to butcher when the killing is especially brutal; soldiers mown down in a hopeless charge are said
to be slaughtered when no brutality on the enemy's part is implied. To despatch is to kill swiftly and in
general quietly, always with intention, with or without right.
Prepositions:
To kill with or by sword, famine, pestilence, care, grief, etc.; killed for his money, by a robber, with a dagger.
* * * * *
KIN.
Synonyms:
affinity, blood, descent, kind, race, alliance, consanguinity, family, kindred, relationship. birth,
Kind is broader than kin, denoting the most general relationship, as of the whole human species in mankind,
humankind, etc.; kin and kindred denote direct relationship that can be traced through either blood or
marriage, preferably the former; either of these words may signify collectively all persons of the same blood
or members of the same family, relatives or relations. Affinity is relationship by marriage, consanguinity is
relationship by blood. There are no true antonyms of kin or kindred, except those made by negatives, since
strangers, aliens, foreigners, and foes may still be kin or kindred.
* * * * *
KNOWLEDGE.
Synonyms:
acquaintance, erudition, learning, recognition, apprehension, experience, light, scholarship, cognition,
information, lore, science, cognizance, intelligence, perception, wisdom. comprehension, intuition,
Knowledge is all that the mind knows, from whatever source derived or obtained, or by whatever process; the
aggregate of facts, truths, or principles acquired or retained by the mind, including alike the intuitions native
to the mind and all that has been learned respecting phenomena, causes, laws, principles, literature, etc. There
is a tendency to regard knowledge as accurate and systematic, and to a certain degree complete. Information is
knowledge of fact, real or supposed, derived from persons, books, or observation, and is regarded as casual
and haphazard. We say of a studious man that he has a great store of knowledge, or of an intelligent man of
the world, that he has a fund of varied information. Lore is used only in poetic or elevated style, for
accumulated knowledge, as of a people or age, or in a more limited sense for learning or erudition. We speak
of perception of external objects, apprehension of intellectual truth. Simple perception gives a limited
knowledge of external objects, merely as such; the cognition of the same objects is a knowledge of them in
some relation; cognizance is the formal or official recognition of something as an object of knowledge; we
take cognizance of it. Intuition is primary knowledge antecedent to all teaching or reasoning, experience is
knowledge that has entered directly into one's own life; as, a child's experience that fire will burn. Learning is
much higher than information, being preeminently wide and systematic knowledge, the result of long,
assiduous study; erudition is recondite learning secured only by extraordinary industry, opportunity, and
ability. Compare ACQUAINTANCE; EDUCATION; SCIENCE; WISDOM.
Antonyms:
ignorance, inexperience, misconception, rudeness, illiteracy, misapprehension, misunderstanding,
unfamiliarity.
* * * * *
LANGUAGE.
Synonyms:
barbarism, expression, patois, vernacular, dialect, idiom, speech, vocabulary. diction, mother tongue, tongue,
Language (F. langage < L. lingua, the tongue) signified originally expression of thought by spoken words, but
now in its widest sense it signifies expression of thought by any means; as, the language of the eyes, the
language of flowers. As regards the use of words, language in its broadest sense denotes all the uttered sounds
and their combinations into words and sentences that human beings employ for the communication of
thought, and, in a more limited sense, the words or combinations forming a means of communication among
the members of a single nation, people, or race. Speech involves always the power of articulate utterance; we
can speak of the language of animals, but not of their speech. A tongue is the speech or language of some one
people, country, or race. A dialect is a special mode of speaking a language peculiar to some locality or class,
not recognized as in accordance with the best usage; a barbarism is a perversion of a language by ignorant
foreigners, or some usage akin to that. Idiom refers to the construction of phrases and sentences, and the way
of forming or using words; it is the peculiar mold in which each language casts its thought. The great
difficulty of translation is to give the thought expressed in one language in the idiom of another. A dialect
may be used by the highest as well as the lowest within its range; a patois is distinctly illiterate, belonging to
the lower classes; those who speak a patois understand the cultured form of their own language, but speak
only the degraded form, as in the case of the Italian lazzaroni or the former negro slaves in the United States.
Vernacular, from the Latin, has the same general sense as the Saxon mother tongue, of one's native language,
or that of a people; as, the Scriptures were translated into the vernacular. Compare DICTION.

LARGE.
Synonyms:
abundant, coarse, gigantic, long, ample, colossal, grand, massive, big, commodious, great, spacious, broad,
considerable, huge, vast, bulky, enormous, immense, wide. capacious, extensive,
Large denotes extension in more than one direction, and beyond the average of the class to which the object
belongs; we speak of a large surface or a large solid, but of a long line; a large field, a large room, a large
apple, etc. A large man is a man of more than ordinary size; a great man is a man of remarkable mental
power. Big is a more emphatic word than large, but of less dignity. We do not say that George Washington
was a big man.
Antonyms:
brief, limited, minute, scanty, small, diminutive, little, narrow, short, tiny, inconsiderable, mean, paltry,
slender, trifling, infinitesimal, microscopic, petty, slight, trivial. insignificant,
* * * * *
LAW.
Synonyms:
canon, economy, legislation, principle, code, edict, mandate, regulation, command, enactment, order, rule,
commandment, formula, ordinance, statute. decree, jurisprudence, polity,
Law, in its ideal, is the statement of a principle of right in mandatory form, by competent authority, with
adequate penalty for disobedience; in common use, the term is applied to any legislative act, however
imperfect or unjust. Command and commandment are personal and particular; as, the commands of a parent;
the ten commandments. An edict is the act of an absolute sovereign or other authority; we speak of the edict of
an emperor, the decree of a court. A mandate is specific, for an occasion or a purpose; a superior court issues
its mandate to an inferior court to send up its records. Statute is the recognized legal term for a specific law;
enactment is the more vague and general expression. We speak of algebraic or chemical formulas, municipal
ordinances, military orders, army regulations, ecclesiastical canons, the rules of a business house. Law is
often used, also, for a recognized principle, whose violation is attended with injury or loss that acts like a
penalty; as, the laws of business; the laws of nature. In more strictly scientific use, a natural law is simply a
recognized system of sequences or relations; as, Kepler's laws of planetary distances. A code is a system of
laws; jurisprudence is the science of law, or a system of laws scientifically considered, classed, and
interpreted; legislation, primarily the act of legislating, denotes also the body of statutes enacted by a
legislative body. An economy (Gr. oikonomia, primarily the management of a house) is any comprehensive
system of administration; as, domestic economy; but the word is extended to the administration or government
of a state or people, signifying a body of laws and regulations, with the entire system, political or religious,
especially the latter, of which they form a part; as, the code of Draco, Roman jurisprudence, British
legislation, the Mosaic economy. Law is also used as a collective noun for a system of laws or recognized
rules or regulations, including not only all special laws, but the principles on which they are based. The
Mosaic economy is known also as the Mosaic law, and we speak of the English common law, or the law of
nations. Polity (Gr. politeia, from polis, a city) signifies the form, constitution, or method of government of a
nation, state, church, or other institution; in usage it differs from economy as applying rather to the system,
while economy applies especially to method, or to the system as administered; an economy might be termed a
polity considered with especial reference to its practical administration, hence commonly with special
reference to details or particulars, while polity has more reference to broad principles.
* * * * *
LIBERTY.
Synonyms:
emancipation, freedom, independence, license.
In general terms, it may be said that freedom is absolute, liberty relative; freedom is the absence of restraint,
liberty is primarily the removal or avoidance of restraint; in its broadest sense, it is the state of being exempt
from the domination of others or from restricting circumstances. Freedom and liberty are constantly
interchanged; the slave is set at liberty, or gains his freedom; but freedom is the nobler word. Independence is
said of states or nations, freedom and liberty of individuals; the independence of the United States did not
secure liberty or freedom to its slaves. Liberty keeps quite strictly to the thought of being clear of restraint or
compulsion; freedom takes a wider range, applying to other oppressive influences; thus, we speak of freedom
from annoyance or intrusion. License is, in its limited sense, a permission or privilege granted by adequate
authority, a bounded liberty; in the wider sense, license is an ignoring and defiance of all that should restrain,
and a reckless doing of all that individual caprice or passion may choose to do--a base and dangerous
counterfeit of freedom. Compare ALLOW; PERMISSION.
Antonyms:
captivity, imprisonment, oppression, slavery, compulsion, necessity, serfdom, superstition, constraint,
obligation, servitude, thraldom.

LIGHT.
Synonyms:
blaze, gleam, glow, shimmer, flame, gleaming, illumination, shine, flare, glimmer, incandescence, shining,
flash, glistening, luster, sparkle, flicker, glistering, scintillation, twinkle, glare, glitter, sheen, twinkling.
Light, strictly denoting a form of radiant energy, is used as a general term for any luminous effect discernible
by the eye, from the faintest phosphorescence to the blaze of the noonday sun. A flame is both hot and
luminous; if it contains few solid particles it will yield little light, tho it may afford intense heat, as in the case
of a hydrogen-flame. A blaze is an extensive, brilliant flame. A flare is a wavering flame or blaze; a flash is a
light that appears and disappears in an instant; as, a flash of lightning; the flash of gunpowder. The glare and
glow are steady, the glare painfully bright, the glow subdued; as, the glare of torches; the glow of dying
embers. Shine and shining refer to a steady or continuous emission of light; sheen is a faint shining, usually by
reflection. Glimmer, glitter, and shimmer denote wavering light. We speak of the glimmer of distant lamps
through the mist; of the shimmer of waves in sunlight or moonlight. A gleam is not wavering, but transient or
intermittent; a sudden gleam of light came through the half-open door; a glitter is a hard light; as, the glitter of
burnished arms. A sparkle is a sudden light, as of sparks thrown out; scintillation is the more exact and
scientific term for the actual emission of sparks, also the figurative term for what suggests such emission; as,
scintillations of wit or of genius. Twinkle and twinkling are used of the intermittent light of the fixed stars.
Glistening is a shining as from a wet surface. Illumination is a wide-spread, brilliant light, as when all the
windows of a house or of a street are lighted. The light of incandescence is intense and white like that from
metal at a white heat.
Antonyms:
blackness, darkness, dusk, gloominess, shade, dark, dimness, gloom, obscurity, shadow.

LIKELY.
Synonyms:
apt, conceivable, liable, probable, credible, conjectural, presumable, reasonable.
Apt implies a natural fitness or tendency; an impetuous person is apt to speak hastily. Liable refers to a
contingency regarded as unfavorable; as, the ship was liable to founder at any moment. Likely refers to a
contingent event regarded as very probable, and usually, tho not always, favorable; as, an industrious worker
is likely to succeed. Credible signifies readily to be believed; as, a credible narrative; likely in such connection
is used ironically to signify the reverse; as, a likely story! A thing is conceivable of which the mind can
entertain the possibility; a thing is conjectural which is conjectured as possible or probable without other
support than a conjecture, or tentative judgment; a thing is presumable which, from what is antecedently
known, may betaken for granted in advance of proof. Reasonable in this connection signifies such as the
reason can be satisfied with, independently of external grounds for belief or disbelief; as, that seems a
reasonable supposition. Compare APPARENT.
Antonyms:
doubtful, improbable, questionable, unreasonable. dubious, incredible, unlikely,
* * * * *
LISTEN.
Synonyms:
attend, hark, harken, hear, heed, list.
Between listen and hear is a difference like that between the words look and see. (Compare synonyms for
LOOK.) To hear is simply to become conscious of sound, to listen is to make a conscious effort or endeavor
to hear. We may hear without listening, as words suddenly uttered in an adjoining room; or we may listen
without hearing, as to a distant speaker. In listening the ear is intent upon the sound; in attending the mind is
intent upon the thought, tho listening implies some attention to the meaning or import of the sound. To heed is
not only to attend, but to remember and observe. Harken is nearly obsolete.
Antonyms:
be deaf to, ignore, neglect, scorn, slight.
Prepositions:
We listen for what we expect or desire to hear; we listen to what we actually do hear; listen for a step, a
signal, a train; listen to the debate.
* * * * *
LITERATURE.
Synonyms:
belles-lettres, literary productions, publications, books, literary works, writings.
Literature is collective, including in the most general sense all the written or printed productions of the human
mind in all lands and ages, or in a more limited sense, referring to all that has been published in some land or
age, or in some department of human knowledge; as, the literature of Greece; the literature of the Augustan
age; the literature of politics or of art. Literature, used absolutely, denotes what has been called "polite
literature" or belles-lettres, i. e., the works collectively that embody taste, feeling, loftiness of thought, and
purity and beauty of style, as poetry, history, fiction, and dramatic compositions, including also much of
philosophical writing, as the "Republic" of Plato, and oratorical productions, as the orations of Demosthenes.
In the broad sense, we can speak of the literature of science; in the narrower sense, we speak of literature and
science as distinct departments of knowledge. Literature is also used to signify literary pursuits or
occupations; as, to devote one's life to literature. Compare KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE.

LOAD, n.
Synonyms:
burden, charge, encumbrance, incubus, pack, cargo, clog, freight, lading, weight.
A burden (from the Anglo-Saxon byrthen, from the verb beran, bear) is what one has to bear, and the word is
used always of that which is borne by a living agent. A load (from the Anglo-Saxon l[=a]d, a way, course,
carrying, or carriage) is what is laid upon a person, animal, or vehicle for conveyance, or what is customarily
so imposed; as, a two-horse load. Weight measures the pressure due to gravity; the same weight that one finds
a moderate load when in his full strength becomes a heavy burden in weariness or weakness. A ship's load is
called distinctively a cargo, or it may be known as freight or lading. Freight denotes merchandise in or for
transportation and is used largely of transportation or of merchandise transported by rail, which is, in
commercial language, said to be "shipped." A load to be fastened upon a horse or mule is called a pack, and
the animal is known as a pack-horse or pack-mule.
* * * * *
LOCK.
Synonyms:
bar, catch, fastening, hook, bolt, clasp, hasp, latch.
A bar is a piece of wood or metal, usually of considerable size, by which an opening is obstructed, a door held
fast, etc. A bar may be movable or permanent; a bolt is a movable rod or pin of metal, sliding in a socket and
adapted for securing a door or window. A lock is an arrangement by which an enclosed bolt is shot forward or
backward by a key, or other device; the bolt is the essential part of the lock. A latch or catch is an accessible
fastening designed to be easily movable, and simply to secure against accidental opening of the door, cover,
etc. A hasp is a metallic strap that fits over a staple, calculated to be secured by a padlock; a simple hook that
fits into a staple is also called a hasp. A clasp is a fastening that can be sprung into place, to draw and hold the
parts of some enclosing object firmly together, as the clasp of a book.
* * * * *
LOOK.
Synonyms:
behold, discern, inspect, see, view, contemplate, gaze, regard, stare, watch. descry, glance, scan, survey,
To see is simply to become conscious of an object of vision; to look is to make a conscious and direct
endeavor to see. To behold is to fix the sight and the mind with distinctness and consideration upon something
that has come to be clearly before the eyes. We may look without seeing, as in pitch-darkness, and we may see
without looking, as in case of a flash of lightning. To gaze is to look intently, long, and steadily upon an
object. To glance is to look casually or momentarily. To stare is to look with a fixed intensity such as is the
effect of surprise, alarm, or rudeness. To scan is to look at minutely, to note every visible feature. To inspect
is to go below the surface, uncover, study item by item. View and survey are comprehensive, survey
expressing the greater exactness of measurement or estimate. Watch brings in the element of time and often of
wariness; we watch for a movement or change, a signal, the approach of an enemy, etc. Compare APPEAR.
* * * * *
LOVE.
Synonyms:
affection, charity, friendship, regard, attachment, devotion, liking, tenderness. attraction, fondness,
Affection is kindly feeling, deep, tender, and constant, going out to some person or object, being less fervent
and ardent than love, whether applied to persons or things. Love is an intense and absorbing emotion, drawing
one toward a person or object and causing one to appreciate, delight in, and crave the presence or possession
of the person or object loved, and to desire to please and benefit the person, or to advance the cause, truth, or
other object of affection; it is the yearning or outgoing of soul toward something that is regarded as excellent,
beautiful, or desirable; love may be briefly defined as strong and absorbing affection for and attraction toward
a person or object. Love may denote the sublimest and holiest spiritual affection as when we are taught that
"God is love." Charity has so far swung aside from this original meaning that probably it never can be recalled
(compare BENEVOLENCE). The Revised Version uses love in place of charity in 1 Cor. xiii, and elsewhere.
Love is more intense, absorbing, and tender than friendship, more intense, impulsive, and perhaps passionate
than affection; we speak of fervent love, but of deep or tender affection, or of close, firm, strong friendship.
Love is used specifically for personal affection between the sexes in the highest sense, the love that normally
leads to marriage, and subsists throughout all happy wedded life. Love can never properly denote mere animal
passion, which is expressed by such words as appetite, desire, lust. One may properly be said to have love for
animals, for inanimate objects, or for abstract qualities that enlist the affections, as we speak of love for a
horse or a dog, for mountains, woods, ocean, or of love of nature, and love of virtue. Love of articles of food is
better expressed by liking, as love, in its full sense, expresses something spiritual and reciprocal, such as can
have no place in connection with objects that minister merely to the senses. Compare ATTACHMENT;
FRIENDSHIP.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ANTIPATHY; ENMITY; HATRED.
Prepositions:
Love of country; for humanity; love to God and man.
* * * * *
MAKE.
Synonyms:
become, constrain, fabricate, manufacture, bring about, construct, fashion, occasion, bring into being, create,
force, perform, bring to pass, do, frame, reach, cause, effect, get, render, compel, establish, make out, require,
compose, execute, make up, shape. constitute,
Make is essentially causative; to the idea of cause all its various senses may be traced (compare synonyms for
CAUSE). To make is to cause to exist, or to cause to exist in a certain form or in certain relations; the word
thus includes the idea of create, as in Gen. i, 31, "And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it
was very good." Make includes also the idea of compose, constitute; as, the parts make up the whole.
Similarly, to cause a voluntary agent to do a certain act is to make him do it, or compel him to do it, compel
fixing the attention more on the process, make on the accomplished fact. Compare COMPEL; DO;
INFLUENCE; (make better) AMEND; (make haste) QUICKEN; (make known) ANNOUNCE; AVOW;
CONFESS; (make prisoner) ARREST; (make up) ADD; (make void) CANCEL.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ABOLISH; BREAK; DEMOLISH.
Prepositions:
Make of, out of, or from certain materials, into a certain form, for a certain purpose or person; made with
hands, by hand; made by a prisoner, with a jack-knife.
* * * * *
MARRIAGE.
Synonyms:
conjugal union, espousals, nuptials, spousals, wedding, espousal, matrimony, spousal, union, wedlock.
Matrimony denotes the state of those who are united in the relation of husband and wife; marriage denotes
primarily the act of so uniting, but is extensively used for the state as well. Wedlock, a word of specific legal
use, is the Saxon term for the state or relation denoted by matrimony. Wedding denotes the ceremony, with
any attendant festivities, by which two persons are united as husband and wife, nuptials being the more formal
and stately term to express the same idea.
Antonyms:
bachelorhood, celibacy, divorce, maidenhood, virginity, widowhood.
Prepositions:
Marriage of or between two persons; of one person to or with another; among the Greeks.
* * * * *
MASCULINE.
Synonyms:
male, manful, manlike, manly, mannish, virile.
We apply male to the sex, masculine to the qualities, especially to the stronger, hardier, and more imperious
qualities that distinguish the male sex; as applied to women, masculine has often the depreciatory sense of
unwomanly, rude, or harsh; as, a masculine face or voice, or the like; tho one may say in a commendatory
way, she acted with masculine courage or decision. Manlike may mean only having the outward appearance or
semblance of a man, or may be closely equivalent to manly. Manly refers to all the qualities and traits worthy
of a man; manful, especially to the valor and prowess that become a man; we speak of a manful struggle,
manly decision; we say manly gentleness or tenderness; we could not say manful tenderness. Mannish is a
depreciatory word referring to the mimicry or parade of some superficial qualities of manhood; as, a mannish
boy or woman. Masculine may apply to the distinctive qualities of the male sex at any age; virile applies to
the distinctive qualities of mature manhood only, as opposed not only to feminine or womanly but to childish,
and is thus an emphatic word for sturdy, intrepid, etc.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for FEMININE.
* * * * *
MASSACRE.
Synonyms:
butchery, carnage, havoc, slaughter.
A massacre is the indiscriminate killing in numbers of the unresisting or defenseless; butchery is the killing of
men rudely and ruthlessly as cattle are killed in the shambles. Havoc may not be so complete as massacre, nor
so coldly brutal as butchery, but is more widely spread and furious; it is destruction let loose, and may be
applied to organizations, interests, etc., as well as to human life; "as for Saul, he made havoc of the church,"
Acts viii, 3. Carnage (Latin caro, carnis, flesh) refers to widely scattered or heaped up corpses of the slain;
slaughter is similar in meaning, but refers more to the process, as carnage does to the result; these two words
only of the group may be used of great destruction of life in open and honorable battle, as when we say the
enemy was repulsed with great slaughter, or the carnage was terrible.
* * * * *
MEDDLESOME.
Synonyms:
impertinent, intrusive, meddling, obtrusive, officious.
The meddlesome person interferes unasked in the affairs of others; the intrusive person thrusts himself
uninvited into their company or conversation; the obtrusive person thrusts himself or his opinions conceitedly
and undesirably upon their notice; the officious person thrusts his services, unasked and undesired, upon
others. Obtrusive is oftener applied to words, qualities, actions, etc., than to persons; intrusive is used chiefly
of persons, as is officious, tho we speak of officious attentions, intrusive remarks; meddlesome is used
indifferently of persons, or of words, qualities, actions, etc. Compare INQUISITIVE; INTERPOSE.
Antonyms:
modest, reserved, retiring, shy, unassuming, unobtrusive.
* * * * *
MELODY.
Synonyms:
harmony, music, symphony, unison.
Harmony is simultaneous; melody is successive; harmony is the pleasing correspondence of two or more notes
sounded at once, melody the pleasing succession of a number of notes continuously following one another. A
melody may be wholly in one part; harmony must be of two or more parts. Accordant notes of different pitch
sounded simultaneously produce harmony; unison is the simultaneous sounding of two or more notes of the
same pitch. When the pitch is the same, there may be unison between sounds of very different volume and
quality, as a voice and a bell may sound in unison. Tones sounded at the interval of an octave are also said to
be in unison, altho this is not literally exact; this usage arises from the fact that bass and tenor voices in
attempting to sound the same note as the soprano and alto will in fact sound a note an octave below. Music
may denote the simplest melody or the most complex and perfect harmony. A symphony (apart from its
technical orchestral sense) is any pleasing consonance of musical sounds, vocal or instrumental, as of many
accordant voices or instruments.
* * * * *
MEMORY.
Synonyms:
recollection, reminiscence, retrospect, retrospection. remembrance,
Memory is the faculty by which knowledge is retained or recalled; in a more general sense, memory is a
retention of knowledge within the grasp of the mind, while remembrance is the having what is known
consciously before the mind. Remembrance may be voluntary or involuntary; a thing is brought to
remembrance or we call it to remembrance; the same is true of memory. Recollection involves volition, the
mind making a distinct effort to recall something, or fixing the attention actively upon it when recalled.
Reminiscence is a half-dreamy memory of scenes or events long past; retrospection is a distinct turning of the
mind back upon the past, bringing long periods under survey. Retrospection is to reminiscence much what
recollection is to remembrance.
Antonyms:
forgetfulness, oblivion, obliviousness, oversight, unconsciousness.
* * * * *
MERCY.
Synonyms:
benevolence, favor, kindness, mildness, benignity, forbearance, lenience, pardon, blessing, forgiveness,
leniency, pity, clemency, gentleness, lenity, tenderness. compassion, grace,
Mercy is the exercise of less severity than one deserves, or in a more extended sense, the granting of kindness
or favor beyond what one may rightly claim. Grace is favor, kindness, or blessing shown to the undeserving;
forgiveness, mercy, and pardon are exercised toward the ill-deserving. Pardon remits the outward penalty
which the offender deserves; forgiveness dismisses resentment or displeasure from the heart of the one
offended; mercy seeks the highest possible good of the offender. There may be mercy without pardon, as in
the mitigation of sentence, or in all possible alleviation of necessary severity; there may be cases where
pardon would not be mercy, since it would encourage to repetition of the offense, from which timely
punishment might have saved. Mercy is also used in the wider sense of refraining from harshness or cruelty
toward those who are in one's power without fault of their own; as, they besought the robber to have mercy.
Clemency is a colder word than mercy, and without its religious associations, signifying mildness and
moderation in the use of power where severity would have legal or military, rather than moral sanction; it
often denotes a habitual mildness of disposition on the part of the powerful, and is matter rather of good nature
or policy than of principle. Leniency or lenity denotes an easy-going avoidance of severity; these words are
more general and less magisterial than clemency; we should speak of the leniency of a parent, the clemency of
a conqueror. Compare PITY.
Antonyms:
cruelty, implacability, punishment, rigor, sternness, hardness, justice, revenge, severity, vengeance. harshness,
penalty,
Prepositions:
The mercy of God to or toward sinners; have mercy on or upon one.
* * * * *
METER.
Synonyms:
euphony, measure, rhythm, verse.
Euphony is agreeable linguistic sound, however produced; meter, measure, and rhythm denote agreeable
succession of sounds in the utterance of connected words; euphony may apply to a single word or even a
single syllable; the other words apply to lines, sentences, paragraphs, etc.; rhythm and meter may be produced
by accent only, as in English, or by accent and quantity combined, as in Greek or Italian; rhythm or measure
may apply either to prose or to poetry, or to music, dancing, etc.; meter is more precise than rhythm, applies
only to poetry, and denotes a measured rhythm with regular divisions into verses, stanzas, strophes, etc. A
verse is strictly a metrical line, but the word is often used as synonymous with stanza. Verse, in the general
sense, denotes metrical writing without reference to the thought involved; as, prose and verse. Compare
MELODY; POETRY.
* * * * *
MIND.
Synonyms:
brain, instinct, reason, spirit, consciousness, intellect, sense, thought, disposition, intelligence, soul,
understanding.
Mind, in a general sense, includes all the powers of sentient being apart from the physical factors in bodily
faculties and activities; in a limited sense, mind is nearly synonymous with intellect, but includes disposition,
or the tendency toward action, as appears in the phrase "to have a mind to work." As the seat of mental
activity, brain (colloquially brains) is often used as a synonym for mind, intellect, intelligence. Thought, the
act, process, or power of thinking, is often used to denote the thinking faculty, and especially the reason. The
instinct of animals is now held by many philosophers to be of the same nature as the intellect of man, but
inferior and limited; yet the apparent difference is very great.
An instinct is a propensity prior to experience and independent of instruction.
PALEY Natural Philosophy ch. 18.
In this sense we speak of human instincts, thus denoting tendencies independent of reasoning or instruction.
The soul includes the intellect, sensibilities, and will; beyond what is expressed by the word mind, the soul
denotes especially the moral, the immortal nature; we say of a dead body, the soul (not the mind) has fled.
Spirit is used especially in contradistinction from matter; it may in many cases be substituted for soul, but soul
has commonly a fuller and more determinate meaning; we can conceive of spirits as having no moral nature;
the fairies, elves, and brownies of mythology might be termed spirits, but not souls. In the figurative sense,
spirit denotes animation, excitability, perhaps impatience; as, a lad of spirit; he sang with spirit; he replied
with spirit. Soul denotes energy and depth of feeling, as when we speak of soulful eyes; or it may denote the
very life of anything; as, "the hidden soul of harmony," MILTON L'Allegro l. 144. Sense may be an antonym
of intellect, as when we speak of the sense of hearing; but sense is used also as denoting clear mental action,
good judgment, acumen; as, he is a man of sense, or, he showed good sense; sense, even in its material
signification, must be reckoned among the activities of mind, tho dependent on bodily functions; the mind, not
the eye, really sees; the mind, not the ear, really hears. Consciousness includes all that a sentient being
perceives, knows, thinks, or feels, from whatever source arising and of whatever character, kind, or degree,
whether with or without distinct thinking, feeling, or willing; we speak of the consciousness of the brute, of
the savage, or of the sage. The intellect is that assemblage of faculties which is concerned with knowledge, as
distinguished from emotion and volition. Understanding is the Saxon word of the same general import, but is
chiefly used of the reasoning powers; the understanding, which Sir Wm. Hamilton has called "the faculty of
relations and comparisons," is distinguished by many philosophers from reason in that "reason is the faculty
of the higher cognitions or a priori truth."
Antonyms:
body, brawn, brute force, material substance, matter.

MINUTE.
Synonyms:
circumstantial, diminutive, little, slender, comminuted, exact, particular, small, critical, fine, precise, tiny.
detailed,
That is minute which is of exceedingly limited dimensions, as a grain of dust, or which attends to matters of
exceedingly slight amount or apparent importance; as, a minute account; minute observation. That which is
broken up into minute particles is said to be comminuted; things may be termed fine which would not be
termed comminuted; as, fine sand; fine gravel; but, in using the adverb, we say a substance is finely
comminuted, comminuted referring more to the process, fine to the result. An account extended to very minute
particulars is circumstantial, detailed, particular; an examination so extended is critical, exact, precise.
Compare FINE.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for LARGE.
* * * * *
MISFORTUNE.
Synonyms:
adversity, disappointment, ill fortune, ruin, affliction, disaster, ill luck, sorrow, bereavement, distress,
misadventure, stroke, blow, failure, mischance, trial, calamity, hardship, misery, tribulation, chastening, harm,
mishap, trouble, chastisement, ill, reverse, visitation.
Misfortune is adverse fortune or any instance thereof, any untoward event, usually of lingering character or
consequences, and such as the sufferer is not deemed directly responsible for; as, he had the misfortune to be
born blind. Any considerable disappointment, failure, or misfortune, as regards outward circumstances, as loss
of fortune, position, and the like, when long continued or attended with enduring consequences, constitutes
adversity. For the loss of friends by death we commonly use affliction or bereavement. Calamity and disaster
are used of sudden and severe misfortunes, often overwhelming; ill fortune and ill luck, of lighter troubles and
failures. We speak of the misery of the poor, the hardships of the soldier. Affliction, chastening, trial, and
tribulation have all an especially religious bearing, suggesting some disciplinary purpose of God with
beneficent design. Affliction may be keen and bitter, but brief; tribulation is long and wearing. We speak of an
affliction, but rarely of a tribulation, since tribulation is viewed as a continuous process, which may endure
for years or for a lifetime; but we speak of our daily trials. Compare CATASTROPHE.
Antonyms:
blessing, consolation, gratification, pleasure, success, boon, good fortune, happiness, prosperity, triumph.
comfort, good luck, joy, relief,
* * * * *
MOB.
Synonyms:
canaille, dregs of the people, masses, rabble, crowd, lower classes, populace, the vulgar.
The populace are poor and ignorant, but may be law-abiding; a mob is disorderly and lawless, but may be rich
and influential. The rabble is despicable, worthless, purposeless; a mob may have effective desperate purpose.
A crowd may be drawn by mere curiosity; some strong, pervading excitement is needed to make it a mob.
Compare PEOPLE.
* * * * *
MODEL.
Synonyms:
archetype, facsimile, original, representation, copy, image, pattern, standard, design, imitation, prototype,
type. example, mold,
A pattern is always, in modern use, that which is to be copied; a model may be either the thing to be copied or
the copy that has been made from it; as, the models in the Patent Office. A pattern is commonly superficial; a
model is usually in relief. A pattern must be closely followed in its minutest particulars by a faithful copyist; a
model may allow a great degree of freedom. A sculptor may idealize his living model; his workmen must
exactly copy in marble or metal the model he has made in clay. Compare EXAMPLE; IDEA; IDEAL.
* * * * *
MODESTY.
Synonyms:
backwardness, constraint, reserve, timidity, bashfulness, coyness, shyness, unobtrusiveness. coldness,
diffidence,
Bashfulness is a shrinking from notice without assignable reason. Coyness is a half encouragement, half
avoidance of offered attention, and may be real or affected. Diffidence is self-distrust; modesty, a humble
estimate of oneself in comparison with others, or with the demands of some undertaking. Modesty has also the
specific meaning of a sensitive shrinking from anything indelicate. Shyness is a tendency to shrink from
observation; timidity, a distinct fear of criticism, error, or failure. Reserve is the holding oneself aloof from
others, or holding back one's feelings from expression, or one's affairs from communication to others. Reserve
may be the retreat of shyness, or, on the other hand, the contemptuous withdrawal of pride and haughtiness.
Compare ABASH; PRIDE; TACITURN.
Antonyms:
abandon, confidence, haughtiness, pertness, arrogance, egotism, impudence, sauciness, assumption,
forwardness, indiscretion, self-conceit, assurance, frankness, loquaciousness, self-sufficiency, boldness,
freedom, loquacity, sociability. conceit,
* * * * *
MONEY.
Synonyms:
bills, cash, funds, property, bullion, coin, gold, silver, capital, currency, notes, specie.
Money is the authorized medium of exchange; coined money is called coin or specie. What are termed in
England bank-notes are in the United States commonly called bills; as, a five-dollar bill. The notes of
responsible men are readily transferable in commercial circles, but they are not money; as, the stock was sold
for $500 in money and the balance in merchantable paper. Cash is specie or money in hand, or paid in hand;
as, the cash account; the cash price. In the legal sense, property is not money, and money is not property; for
property is that which has inherent value, while money, as such, has but representative value, and may or may
not have intrinsic value. Bullion is either gold or silver uncoined, or the coined metal considered without
reference to its coinage, but simply as merchandise, when its value as bullion may be very different from its
value as money. The word capital is used chiefly of accumulated property or money invested in productive
enterprises or available for such investment.
* * * * *
MOROSE.
Synonyms:
acrimonious, dogged, ill-natured, splenetic, churlish, gloomy, severe, sulky, crabbed, gruff, snappish, sullen,
crusty, ill-humored, sour, surly.
The sullen and sulky are discontented and resentful in regard to that against which they are too proud to
protest, or consider all protest vain; sullen denotes more of pride, sulky more of resentful obstinacy. The
morose are bitterly dissatisfied with the world in general, and disposed to vent their ill nature upon others. The
sullen and sulky are for the most part silent; the morose growl out bitter speeches. A surly person is in a state
of latent anger, resenting approach as intrusion, and ready to take offense at anything; thus we speak of a surly
dog. Sullen and sulky moods may be transitory; one who is morose or surly is commonly so by disposition or
habit.
Antonyms:
amiable, complaisant, gentle, kind, pleasant, benignant, friendly, good-natured, loving, sympathetic, bland,
genial, indulgent, mild, tender.
* * * * *
MOTION.
Synonyms:
act, change, movement, process, transition. action, move, passage, transit,
Motion is change of place or position in space; transition is a passing from one point or position in space to
another. Motion may be either abstract or concrete, more frequently the former; movement is always concrete,
that is, considered in connection with the thing that moves or is moved; thus, we speak of the movements of
the planets, but of the laws of planetary motion; of military movements, but of perpetual motion. Move is used
chiefly of contests or competition, as in chess or politics; as, it is your move; a shrewd move of the opposition.
Action is a more comprehensive word than motion. We now rarely speak of mental or spiritual motions, but
rather of mental or spiritual acts or processes, or of the laws of mental action, but a formal proposal of action
in a deliberative assembly is termed a motion. Compare ACT.
Antonyms:
immobility, quiescence, quiet, repose, rest, stillness.
* * * * *
MOURN.
Synonyms:
bemoan, deplore, lament, regret, rue, sorrow. bewail, grieve,
To mourn is to feel or express sadness or distress because of some loss, affliction, or misfortune; mourning is
thought of as prolonged, grief or regret may be transient. One may grieve or mourn, regret, rue, or sorrow
without a sound; he bemoans with suppressed and often inarticulate sounds of grief; he bewails with
passionate utterance, whether of inarticulate cries or of spoken words. He laments in plaintive or pathetic
words, as the prophet Jeremiah in his "Lamentations." One deplores with settled sorrow which may or may
not find relief in words. One is made to rue an act by some misfortune resulting, or by some penalty or
vengeance inflicted because of it. One regrets a slight misfortune or a hasty word; he sorrows over the death
of a friend.
Antonyms:
be joyful, exult, joy, make merry, rejoice, triumph.
* * * * *
MUTUAL.
Synonyms:
common, correlative, interchangeable, joint, reciprocal.
That is common to which two or more persons have the same or equal claims, or in which they have equal
interest or participation; in the strictest sense, that is mutual (Latin mutare, to change) which is freely
interchanged; that is reciprocal in respect to which one act or movement is met by a corresponding act or
movement in return; we speak of our common country, mutual affection, reciprocal obligations, the
reciprocal action of cause and effect, where the effect becomes in turn a cause. Many good writers hold it
incorrect to say "a mutual friend," and insist that "a common friend" would be more accurate; but "common
friend" is practically never used, because of the disagreeable suggestion that attaches to common, of ordinary
or inferior. "Mutual friend" has high literary authority (of Burke, Scott, Dickens, and others), and a
considerable usage of good society in its favor, the expression being quite naturally derived from the
thoroughly correct phrase mutual friendship.
Antonyms:
detached, distinct, separated, unconnected, unrequited, disconnected, disunited, severed, unreciprocated,
unshared. dissociated, separate, sundered,

MYSTERIOUS.
Synonyms:
abstruse, inexplicable, recondite, cabalistic, inscrutable, secret, dark, mystic, transcendental, enigmatical,
mystical, unfathomable, hidden, obscure, unfathomed, incomprehensible, occult, unknown.
That is mysterious in the true sense which is beyond human comprehension, as the decrees of God or the
origin of life. That is mystic or mystical which has associated with it some hidden or recondite meaning,
especially of a religious kind; as, the mystic Babylon of the Apocalypse. That is dark which we can not
personally see through, especially if sadly perplexing; as, a dark providence. That is secret which is
intentionally hidden. Compare DARK.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for CLEAR.

NAME.
Synonyms:
agnomen, denomination, prenomen, surname, appellation, designation, style, title. cognomen, epithet,
Name in the most general sense, signifying the word by which a person or thing is called or known, includes
all other words of this group; in this sense every noun is a name; in the more limited sense a name is personal,
an appellation is descriptive, a title is official. In the phrase William the Conqueror, King of England, William
is the man's name, which belongs to him personally, independently of any rank or achievement; Conqueror is
the appellation which he won by his acquisition of England; King is the title denoting his royal rank. An
epithet (Gr. epitheton, something added, from epi, on, and tithemi, put) is something placed upon a person or
thing; the epithet does not strictly belong to an object like a name, but is given to mark some assumed
characteristic, good or bad; an epithet is always an adjective, or a word or phrase used as an adjective, and is
properly used to emphasize a characteristic but not to add information, as in the phrase "the sounding sea;" the
idea that an epithet is always opprobrious, and that any word used opprobriously is an epithet is a popular
error. Designation may be used much in the sense of appellation, but is more distinctive or specific in
meaning; a designation properly so called rests upon some inherent quality, while an appellation may be
fanciful. Among the Romans the prenomen was the individual part of a man's name, the "nomen" designated
the gens to which he belonged, the cognomen showed his family and was borne by all patricians, and the
agnomen was added to refer to his achievements or character. When scientists name an animal or a plant, they
give it a binary or binomial technical name comprising a generic and a specific appellation. In modern use, a
personal name, as John or Mary, is given in infancy, and is often called the given name or Christian name, or
simply the first name (rarely the prenomen); the cognomen or surname is the family name which belongs to
one by right of birth or marriage. Style is the legal designation by which a person or house is known in official
or business relations; as, the name and style of Baring Brothers. The term denomination is applied to a
separate religious organization, without the opprobrious meaning attaching to the word "sect;" also, to
designate any class of like objects collectively, especially money or notes of a certain value; as, the sum was
in notes of the denomination of one thousand dollars. Compare TERM.
* * * * *
NATIVE.
Synonyms:
indigenous, innate, natal, natural, original.
Native denotes that which belongs to one by birth; natal that which pertains to the event of birth; natural
denotes that which rests upon inherent qualities of character or being. We speak of one's native country, or of
his natal day; of natural ability, native genius. Compare INHERENT; PRIMEVAL; RADICAL.
Antonyms:
acquired, alien, artificial, assumed, foreign, unnatural.

Marine (L. mare, sea) signifies belonging to the ocean, maritime, a secondary derivative from the same root,
bordering on or connected with the ocean; as, marine products; marine animals; maritime nations; maritime
laws. Nautical (Gr. nautes, a sailor) denotes primarily anything connected with sailors, and hence with ships
or navigation; naval (L. navis, Gr. naus, a ship) refers to the armed force of a nation on the sea, and, by
extension, to similar forces on lakes and rivers; as, a naval force; a nautical almanac. Ocean, used adjectively,
is applied to that which belongs to or is part of the ocean; oceanic may be used in the same sense, but is
especially applied to that which borders on (or upon) or is connected with, or which is similar to or suggestive
of an ocean; we speak of ocean currents, oceanic islands, or, perhaps, of an oceanic intellect.

NEAT.
Synonyms:
clean, dapper, nice, prim, tidy, cleanly, natty, orderly, spruce, trim.
That which is clean is simply free from soil or defilement of any kind. Things are orderly when in due relation
to other things; a room or desk is orderly when every article is in place; a person is orderly who habitually
keeps things so. Tidy denotes that which conforms to propriety in general; an unlaced shoe may be perfectly
clean, but is not tidy. Neat refers to that which is clean and tidy with nothing superfluous, conspicuous, or
showy, as when we speak of plain but neat attire; the same idea of freedom from the superfluous appears in
the phrases "a neat speech," "a neat turn," "a neat reply," etc. A clean cut has no ragged edges; a neat stroke
just does what is intended. Nice is stronger than neat, implying value and beauty; a cheap, coarse dress may
be perfectly neat, but would not be termed nice. Spruce is applied to the show and affectation of neatness with
a touch of smartness, and is always a term of mild contempt; as, a spruce serving man. Trim denotes a certain
shapely and elegant firmness, often with suppleness and grace; as, a trim suit; a trim figure. Prim applies to a
precise, formal, affected nicety. Dapper is spruce with the suggestion of smallness and slightness; natty, a
diminutive of neat, suggests minute elegance, with a tendency toward the exquisite; as, a dapper little fellow
in a natty business suit.
Antonyms:
dirty, negligent, slouchy, uncared for, disorderly, rough, slovenly, unkempt, dowdy, rude, soiled, untidy.

NECESSARY.
Synonyms:
essential, infallible, required, unavoidable, indispensable, needed, requisite, undeniable. inevitable, needful,
That is necessary which must exist, occur, or be true; which in the nature of things can not be otherwise. That
which is essential belongs to the essence of a thing, so that the thing can not exist in its completeness without
it; that which is indispensable may be only an adjunct, but it is one that can not be spared; vigorous health is
essential to an arctic explorer; warm clothing is indispensable. That which is requisite (or required) is so in
the judgment of the person requiring it, but may not be so absolutely; thus, the requisite is more a matter of
personal feeling than the indispensable. Inevitable (L. in, not, and evito, shun) is primarily the exact
equivalent of the Saxon unavoidable; both words are applied to things which some at least would escape or
prevent, while that which is necessary may meet with no objection; food is necessary, death is inevitable; a
necessary conclusion satisfies a thinker; an inevitable conclusion silences opposition. An infallible proof is
one that necessarily leads the mind to a sound conclusion. Needed and needful are more concrete than
necessary, and respect an end to be attained; we speak of a necessary inference; necessary food is what one
can not live without, while needful food is that without which he can not enjoy comfort, health, and strength.
Antonyms:
casual, needless, optional, useless, contingent, non-essential, unnecessary, worthless.
Prepositions:
Necessary to a sequence or a total; for or to a result or a person; unity is necessary to (to constitute)
completeness; decision is necessary for command, or for a commander.
* * * * *
NECESSITY.
Synonyms:
compulsion, fatality, requisite, destiny, fate, sine qua non, emergency, indispensability, unavoidableness,
essential, indispensableness, urgency, exigency, need, want. extremity, requirement,
Necessity is the quality of being necessary, or the quality of that which can not but be, become, or be true, or
be accepted as true. Need and want always imply a lack; necessity may be used in this sense, but in the higher
philosophical sense necessity simply denotes the exclusion of any alternative either in thought or fact;
righteousness is a necessity (not a need) of the divine nature. Need suggests the possibility of supplying the
deficiency which want expresses; to speak of a person's want of decision merely points out a weakness in his
character; to say that he has need of decision implies that he can exercise or attain it. As applied to a
deficiency, necessity is more imperative than need; a weary person is in need of rest; when rest becomes a
necessity he has no choice but to stop work. An essential is something, as a quality, or element, that belongs
to the essence of something else so as to be inseparable from it in its normal condition, or in any complete
idea or statement of it. Compare NECESSARY; PREDESTINATION.
Antonyms:
choice, doubt, dubiousness, freedom, possibility, contingency, doubtfulness, fortuity, option, uncertainty.
Prepositions:
The necessity of surrender; a necessity for action; this is a necessity to me.
* * * * *
NEGLECT.
Synonyms:
carelessness, heedlessness, negligence, scorn, default, inadvertence, omission, slackness, disregard,
inattention, oversight, slight, disrespect, indifference, remissness, thoughtlessness. failure, neglectfulness,
Neglect (L. nec, not, and lego, gather) is the failing to take such care, show such attention, pay such courtesy,
etc., as may be rightfully or reasonably expected. Negligence, which is the same in origin, may be used in
almost the same sense, but with a slighter force, as when Whittier speaks of "the negligence which friendship
loves;" but negligence is often used to denote the quality or trait of character of which the act is a
manifestation, or to denote the habit of neglecting that which ought to be done. Neglect is transitive,
negligence is intransitive; we speak of neglect of his books, friends, or duties, in which cases we could not use
negligence; negligence in dress implies want of care as to its arrangement, tidiness, etc.; neglect of one's
garments would imply leaving them exposed to defacement or injury, as by dust, moths, etc. Neglect has a
passive sense which negligence has not; the child was suffering from neglect, i. e., from being neglected by
others; the child was suffering from negligence would imply that he himself was neglectful. The distinction
sometimes made that neglect denotes the act, and negligence the habit, is but partially true; one may be guilty
of habitual neglect of duty; the wife may suffer from her husband's constant neglect, while the negligence
which causes a railroad accident may be that of a moment, and on the part of one ordinarily careful and
attentive; in such cases the law provides punishment for criminal negligence.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for CARE.
Prepositions:
Neglect of duty, of the child by the parent; there was neglect on the part of the teacher.
* * * * *
NEW.
Synonyms:
fresh, modern, new-made, upstart, juvenile, new-fangled, novel, young, late, new-fashioned, recent, youthful.
That which is new has lately come into existence, possession, or use; a new house is just built, or in a more
general sense is one that has just come into the possession of the present owner or occupant. Modern denotes
that which has begun to exist in the present age, and is still existing; recent denotes that which has come into
existence within a comparatively brief period, and may or may not be existing still. Modern history pertains to
any period since the middle ages; modern literature, modern architecture, etc., are not strikingly remote from
the styles and types prevalent to-day. That which is late is somewhat removed from the present, but not far
enough to be called old. That which is recent is not quite so sharply distinguished from the past as that which
is new; recent publications range over a longer time than new books. That which is novel is either absolutely
or relatively unprecedented in kind; a novel contrivance is one that has never before been known; a novel
experience is one that has never before occurred to the same person; that which is new may be of a familiar or
even of an ancient sort, as a new copy of an old book. Young and youthful are applied to that which has life;
that which is young is possessed of a comparatively new existence as a living thing, possessing actual youth;
that which is youthful manifests the attributes of youth. (Compare YOUTHFUL.) Fresh applies to that which
has the characteristics of newness or youth, while capable of deterioration by lapse of time; that which is
unworn, unspoiled, or unfaded; as, a fresh countenance, fresh eggs, fresh flowers. New is opposed to old,
modern to ancient, recent to remote, young to old, aged, etc.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for OLD.

NIMBLE.
Synonyms:
active, alert, bustling, prompt, speedy, spry, agile, brisk, lively, quick, sprightly, swift.
Nimble refers to lightness, freedom, and quickness of motion within a somewhat narrow range, with readiness
to turn suddenly to any point; swift applies commonly to more sustained motion over greater distances; a
pickpocket is nimble-fingered, a dancer nimble-footed; an arrow, a race-horse, or an ocean steamer is swift;
Shakespeare's "nimble lightnings" is said of the visual appearance in sudden zigzag flash across the sky.
Figuratively, we speak of nimble wit, swift intelligence, swift destruction. Alert, which is strictly a synonym
for ready, comes sometimes near the meaning of nimble or quick, from the fact that the ready, wide-awake
person is likely to be lively, quick, speedy. Compare ACTIVE; ALERT.
Antonyms:
clumsy, dull, heavy, inactive, inert, slow, sluggish, unready. dilatory,
* * * * *
NORMAL.
Synonyms:
common, natural, ordinary, regular, typical, usual.
That which is natural is according to nature; that which is normal is according to the standard or rule which is
observed or claimed to prevail in nature; a deformity may be natural, symmetry is normal; the normal color
of the crow is black, while the normal color of the sparrow is gray, but one is as natural as the other. Typical
refers to such an assemblage of qualities as makes the specimen, genus, etc., a type of some more
comprehensive group, while normal is more commonly applied to the parts of a single object; the specimen
was typical; color, size, and other characteristics, normal. The regular is etymologically that which is
according to rule, hence that which is steady and constant, as opposed to that which is fitful and changeable;
the normal action of the heart is regular. That which is common is shared by a great number of persons or
things; disease is common, a normal state of health is rare. Compare GENERAL; USUAL.
Antonyms:
abnormal, irregular, peculiar, singular, unprecedented, exceptional, monstrous, rare, uncommon, unusual.
* * * * *
NOTWITHSTANDING, conj.
Synonyms:
altho(ugh), howbeit, nevertheless, tho(ugh), but, however, still, yet.
However simply waives discussion, and (like the archaic howbeit) says "be that as it may, this is true;"
nevertheless concedes the truth of what precedes, but claims that what follows is none the less true;
notwithstanding marshals the two statements face to face, admits the one and its seeming contradiction to the
other, while insisting that it can not, after all, withstand the other; as, notwithstanding the force of the enemy
is superior, we shall conquer. Yet and still are weaker than notwithstanding, while stronger than but. Tho and
altho make as little as possible of the concession, dropping it, as it were, incidentally; as, "tho we are guilty,
thou art good;" to say "we are guilty, but thou art good," would make the concession of guilt more emphatic.
Compare BUT; YET.
* * * * *
NOTWITHSTANDING, prep.
Synonyms:
despite, in spite of.
Notwithstanding simply states that circumstances shall not be or have not been allowed to withstand; despite
and in spite of refer primarily to personal and perhaps spiteful opposition; as, he failed notwithstanding his
good intentions; or, he persevered in spite of the most bitter hostility. When despite and in spite of are applied
to inanimate things, it is with something of personification; "in spite of the storm" is said as if the storm had a
hostile purpose to oppose the undertaking.
* * * * *
OATH.
Synonyms:
adjuration, curse, profane swearing, affidavit, cursing, profanity, anathema, denunciation, reprobation, ban,
execration, swearing, blaspheming, imprecation, sworn statement. blasphemy, malediction, vow.
In the highest sense, as in a court of justice, "an oath is a reverent appeal to God in corroboration of what one
says," ABBOTT Law Dict.; an affidavit is a sworn statement made in writing in the presence of a competent
officer; an adjuration is a solemn appeal to a person in the name of God to speak the truth. An oath is made to
man in the name of God; a vow, to God without the intervention, often without the knowledge, of man. In the
lower sense, an oath may be mere blasphemy or profane swearing. Anathema, curse, execration, and
imprecation are modes of invoking vengeance or retribution from a superhuman power upon the person
against whom they are uttered. Anathema is a solemn ecclesiastical condemnation of a person or of a
proposition. Curse may be just and authoritative; as, the curse of God; or, it may be wanton and powerless:
"so the curse causeless shall not come," Prov. xxvi, 2. Execration expresses most of personal bitterness and
hatred; imprecation refers especially to the coming of the desired evil upon the person against whom it is
uttered. Malediction is a general wish of evil, a less usual but very expressive word. Compare TESTIMONY.
Antonyms:
benediction, benison, blessing.

OBSCURE.
Synonyms:
abstruse, darksome, dusky, involved, ambiguous, deep, enigmatical, muddy, cloudy, dense, hidden,
mysterious, complex, difficult, incomprehensible, profound, complicated, dim, indistinct, turbid, dark,
doubtful, intricate, unintelligible.
That is obscure which the eye or the mind can not clearly discern or see through, whether because of its own
want of transparency, its depth or intricacy, or because of mere defect of light. That which is complicated is
likely to be obscure, but that may be obscure which is not at all complicated and scarcely complex, as a muddy
pool. In that which is abstruse (L. abs, from, and trudo, push) as if removed from the usual course of thought
or out of the way of apprehension or discovery, the thought is remote, hidden; in that which is obscure there
may be nothing to hide; it is hard to see to the bottom of the profound, because of its depth, but the most
shallow turbidness is obscure. Compare COMPLEX; DARK; DIFFICULT; MYSTERIOUS.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for CLEAR.
* * * * *
OBSOLETE.
Synonyms:
ancient, archaic, obsolescent, out of date, antiquated, disused, old, rare.
Some of the oldest or most ancient words are not obsolete, as father, mother, etc. A word is obsolete which
has quite gone out of reputable use; a word is archaic which is falling out of reputable use, or, on the other
hand, having been obsolete, is taken up tentatively by writers or speakers of influence, so that it may perhaps
regain its position as a living word; a word is rare if there are few present instances of its reputable use.
Compare OLD.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for NEW.

OBSTINATE.
Synonyms:
contumacious, headstrong, mulish, resolute, decided, heady, obdurate, resolved, determined, immovable,
opinionated, stubborn, dogged, indomitable, persistent, unconquerable, firm, inflexible, pertinacious,
unflinching, fixed, intractable, refractory, unyielding.
The headstrong person is not to be stopped in his own course of action, while the obstinate and stubborn is
not to be driven to another's way. The headstrong act; the obstinate and stubborn may simply refuse to stir.
The most amiable person may be obstinate on some one point; the stubborn person is for the most part
habitually so; we speak of obstinate determination, stubborn resistance. Stubborn is the term most frequently
applied to the lower animals and inanimate things. Refractory implies more activity of resistance; the
stubborn horse balks; the refractory animal plunges, rears, and kicks; metals that resist ordinary processes of
reduction are termed refractory. One is obdurate who adheres to his purpose in spite of appeals that would
move any tender-hearted or right-minded person. Contumacious refers to a proud and insolent defiance of
authority, as of the summons of a court. Pertinacious demand is contrasted with obstinate refusal. The
unyielding conduct which we approve we call decided, firm, inflexible, resolute; that which we condemn we
are apt to term headstrong, obstinate, stubborn. Compare PERVERSE.
Antonyms:
amenable, dutiful, pliable, tractable, complaisant, gentle, pliant, undecided, compliant, irresolute, submissive,
wavering, docile, obedient, teachable, yielding.
* * * * *
OBSTRUCT.
Synonyms:
arrest, check, embarrass, interrupt, stay, bar, choke, hinder, oppose, stop. barricade, clog, impede, retard,
To obstruct is literally to build up against; the road is obstructed by fallen trees; the passage of liquid through
a tube is obstructed by solid deposits. We may hinder one's advance by following and clinging to him; we
obstruct his course by standing in his way or putting a barrier across his path. Anything that makes one's
progress slower, whether from within or from without, impedes; an obstruction is always from without. To
arrest is to cause to stop suddenly; obstructing the way may have the effect of arresting progress. Compare
HINDER; IMPEDIMENT.
Antonyms:
accelerate, aid, facilitate, free, open, promote. advance, clear, forward, further, pave the way for,
* * * * *
OLD.
Synonyms:
aged, decrepit, immemorial, senile, ancient, elderly, olden, time-honored, antiquated, gray, patriarchal,
time-worn, antique, hoary, remote, venerable.
That is termed old which has existed long, or which existed long ago. Ancient, from the Latin, through the
French, is the more stately, old, from the Saxon, the more familiar word. Familiarity, on one side, is near to
contempt; thus we say, an old coat, an old hat. On the other hand, familiarity is akin to tenderness, and thus
old is a word of endearment; as, "the old homestead," the "old oaken bucket." "Tell me the old, old story!" has
been sung feelingly by millions; "tell me that ancient story" would remove it out of all touch of human
sympathy. Olden is a statelier form of old, and is applied almost exclusively to time, not to places, buildings,
persons, etc. As regards periods of time, the familiar are also the near; thus, the old times are not too far away
for familiar thought and reference; the olden times are more remote, ancient times still further removed. Gray,
hoary, and moldering refer to outward and visible tokens of age. Aged applies chiefly to long-extended human
life. Decrepit, gray, and hoary refer to the effects of age on the body exclusively; senile upon the mind also;
as, a decrepit frame, senile garrulousness. One may be aged and neither decrepit nor senile. Elderly is applied
to those who have passed middle life, but scarcely reached old age. Remote (L. re, back or away, and moveo,
move), primarily refers to space, but is extended to that which is far off in time; as, at some remote period.
Venerable expresses the involuntary reverence that we yield to the majestic and long-enduring, whether in the
material world or in human life and character. Compare ANTIQUE; OBSOLETE; PRIMEVAL.

OPERATION.
Synonyms:
action, effect, force, performance, result. agency, execution, influence, procedure,
Operation is action considered with reference to the thing acted upon, and may apply to the action of an
intelligent agent or of a material substance or force; as, the operation of a medicine. Performance and
execution denote intelligent action, considered with reference to the actor or to that which he accomplishes;
performance accomplishing the will of the actor, execution often the will of another; we speak of the
performance of a duty, the execution of a sentence. Compare ACT.
Antonyms:
failure, ineffectiveness, inutility, powerlessness, uselessness. inaction, inefficiency,
* * * * *
ORDER.
Synonyms:
command, injunction, mandate, requirement. direction, instruction, prohibition,
Instruction implies superiority of knowledge, direction of authority on the part of the giver; a teacher gives
instructions to his pupils, an employer gives directions to his workmen. Order is still more authoritative than
direction; soldiers, sailors, and railroad employees have simply to obey the orders of their superiors, without
explanation or question; an order in the commercial sense has the authority of the money which the one
ordering the goods pays or is to pay. Command is a loftier word, as well as highly authoritative, less frequent
in common life; we speak of the commands of God, or sometimes, by polite hyperbole, ask of a friend, "Have
you any commands for me?" A requirement is imperative, but not always formal, nor made by a personal
agent; it may be in the nature of things; as, the requirements of the position. Prohibition is wholly negative; it
is a command not to do; injunction is now oftenest so used, especially as the requirement by legal authority
that certain action be suspended or refrained from, pending final legal decision. Compare ARRAY; CLASS;
LAW; PROHIBIT; SYSTEM.
Antonyms:
allowance, consent, leave, liberty, license, permission, permit.
* * * * *
OSTENTATION.
Synonyms:
boast, flourish, parade, pompousness, vaunt, boasting, pageant, pomp, show, vaunting. display, pageantry,
pomposity,
Ostentation is an ambitious showing forth of whatever is thought adapted to win admiration or praise;
ostentation may be without words; as, the ostentation of wealth in fine residences, rich clothing, costly
equipage, or the like; when in words, ostentation is rather in manner than in direct statement; as, the
ostentation of learning. Boasting is in direct statement, and is louder and more vulgar than ostentation. There
may be great display or show with little substance; ostentation suggests something substantial to be shown.
Pageant, pageantry, parade, and pomp refer principally to affairs of arms or state; as, a royal pageant; a
military parade. Pomp is some material demonstration of wealth and power, as in grand and stately
ceremonial, rich furnishings, processions, etc., considered as worthy of the person or occasion in whose behalf
it is manifested; pomp is the noble side of that which as ostentation is considered as arrogant and vain.
Pageant and pageantry are inferior to pomp, denoting spectacular display designed to impress the public
mind, and since the multitude is largely ignorant and thoughtless, the words pageant and pageantry have a
suggestion of the transient and unsubstantial. Parade (L. paro, prepare) is an exhibition as of troops in camp
going through the evolutions that are to be used in battle, and suggests a lack of earnestness and direct or
immediate occasion or demand; hence, in the more general sense, a parade is an uncalled for exhibition, and
so used is a more disparaging word than ostentation; ostentation may spring merely from undue
self-gratulation, parade implies a desire to impress others with a sense of one's abilities or resources, and is
always offensive and somewhat contemptible; as, a parade of wealth or learning. Pomposity and pompousness
are the affectation of pomp.
Antonyms:
diffidence, quietness, retirement, timidity, modesty, reserve, shrinking, unobtrusiveness.
* * * * *
OUGHT.
Synonym:
should.
One ought to do that which he is under moral obligation or in duty bound to do. Ought is the stronger word,
holding most closely to the sense of moral obligation, or sometimes of imperative logical necessity; should
may have the sense of moral obligation or may apply merely to propriety or expediency, as in the proverb,
"The liar should have a good memory," i. e., he will need it. Ought is sometimes used of abstractions or
inanimate things as indicating what the mind deems to be imperative or logically necessary in view of all the
conditions; as, these goods ought to go into that space; these arguments ought to convince him; should in such
connections would be correct, but less emphatic. Compare DUTY.
* * * * *
OVERSIGHT.
Synonyms:
care, control, management, surveillance, charge, direction, superintendence, watch, command, inspection,
supervision, watchfulness.
A person may look over a matter in order to survey it carefully in its entirety, or he may look over it with no
attention to the thing itself because his gaze and thought are concentrated on something beyond; oversight has
thus two contrasted senses, in the latter sense denoting inadvertent error or omission, and in the former
denoting watchful supervision, commonly implying constant personal presence; superintendence requires
only so much of presence or communication as to know that the superintendent's wishes are carried out; the
superintendent of a railroad will personally oversee very few of its operations; the railroad company has
supreme direction of all its affairs without superintendence or oversight. Control is used chiefly with
reference to restraint or the power of restraint; a good horseman has a restless horse under perfect control;
there is no high character without self-control. Surveillance is an invidious term signifying watching with
something of suspicion. Compare CARE; NEGLECT.
* * * * *
PAIN.
Synonyms:
ache, distress, suffering, torture, agony, pang, throe, twinge, anguish, paroxysm, torment, wo(e).
Pain is the most general term of this group, including all the others; pain is a disturbing sensation from which
nature revolts, resulting from some injurious external interference (as from a wound, a bruise, a harsh word,
etc.), or from some lack of what one needs, craves, or cherishes (as, the pain of hunger or bereavement), or
from some abnormal action of bodily or mental functions (as, the pains of disease, envy, or discontent).
Suffering is one of the severer forms of pain. The prick of a needle causes pain, but we should scarcely speak
of it as suffering. Distress is too strong a word for little hurts, too feeble for the intensest suffering, but
commonly applied to some continuous or prolonged trouble or need; as, the distress of a shipwrecked crew, or
of a destitute family. Ache is lingering pain, more or less severe; pang, a pain short, sharp, intense, and
perhaps repeated. We speak of the pangs of hunger or of remorse. Throe is a violent and thrilling pain.
Paroxysm applies to an alternately recurring and receding pain, which comes as it were in waves; the
paroxysm is the rising of the wave. Torment and torture are intense and terrible sufferings. Agony and anguish
express the utmost pain or suffering of body or mind. Agony of body is that with which the system struggles;
anguish that by which it is crushed.
Antonyms:
comfort, delight, ease, enjoyment, peace, rapture, relief, solace.
* * * * *
PALLIATE.
Synonyms:
apologize for, conceal, extenuate, hide, screen, cloak, cover, gloss over, mitigate, veil.
Cloak, from the French, and palliate, from the Latin, are the same in original signification, but have diverged
in meaning; a cloak may be used to hide completely the person or some object carried about the person, or it
may but partly veil the figure, making the outlines less distinct; cloak is used in the former, palliate, in the
latter sense; to cloak a sin is to attempt to hide it from discovery; to palliate it is to attempt to hide some part
of its blameworthiness. "When we palliate our own or others' faults we do not seek to cloke them altogether,
but only to extenuate the guilt of them in part." TRENCH Study of Words lect. vi, p. 266. Either to palliate or
to extenuate is to admit the fault; but to extenuate is rather to apologize for the offender, while to palliate is to
disguise the fault; hence, we speak of extenuating but not of palliating circumstances, since circumstances can
not change the inherent wrong of an act, tho they may lessen the blameworthiness of him who does it;
palliating a bad thing by giving it a mild name does not make it less evil. In reference to diseases, to palliate
is really to diminish their violence, or partly to relieve the sufferer. Compare ALLEVIATE; HIDE.
* * * * *
PARDON, v.
Synonyms:
absolve, condone, forgive, pass by, remit. acquit, excuse, overlook, pass over,
To pardon is to let pass, as a fault or sin, without resentment, blame, or punishment. Forgive has reference to
feelings, pardon to consequences; hence, the executive may pardon, but has nothing to do officially with
forgiving. Personal injury may be forgiven by the person wronged; thus, God at once forgives and pardons;
the pardoned sinner is exempt from punishment; the forgiven sinner is restored to the divine favor. To pardon
is the act of a superior, implying the right to punish; to forgive is the privilege of the humblest person who has
been wronged or offended. In law, to remit the whole penalty is equivalent to pardoning the offender; but a
part of a penalty may be remitted and the remainder inflicted, as where the penalty includes both fine and
imprisonment. To condone is to put aside a recognized offense by some act which restores the offender to
forfeited right or privilege, and is the act of a private individual, without legal formalities. To excuse is to
overlook some slight offense, error, or breach of etiquette; pardon is often used by courtesy in nearly the same
sense. A person may speak of excusing or forgiving himself, but not of pardoning himself. Compare
ABSOLVE; PARDON, n.
Antonyms:
castigate, chastise, convict, doom, recompense, sentence, chasten, condemn, correct, punish, scourge, visit.
* * * * *
PARDON, n.
Synonyms:
absolution, amnesty, forgiveness, oblivion, acquittal, forbearance, mercy, remission.
Acquittal is a release from a charge, after trial, as not guilty. Pardon is a removal of penalty from one who has
been adjudged guilty. Acquittal is by the decision of a court, commonly of a jury; pardon is the act of the
executive. An innocent man may demand acquittal, and need not plead for pardon. Pardon supposes an
offense; yet, as our laws stand, to grant a pardon is sometimes the only way to release one who has been
wrongly convicted. Oblivion, from the Latin, signifies overlooking and virtually forgetting an offense, so that
the offender stands before the law in all respects as if it had never been committed. Amnesty brings the same
idea through the Greek. Pardon affects individuals; amnesty and oblivion are said of great numbers. Pardon is
oftenest applied to the ordinary administration of law; amnesty, to national and military affairs. An amnesty is
issued after war, insurrection, or rebellion; it is often granted by "an act of oblivion," and includes a full
pardon of all offenders who come within its provisions. Absolution is a religious word (compare synonyms
for ABSOLVE). Remission is a discharge from penalty; as, the remission of a fine.
Antonyms:
penalty, punishment, retaliation, retribution, vengeance.
Prepositions:
A pardon to or for the offenders; for all offenses; the pardon of offenders or offenses.

(archaic); in general, to part from is to relinquish companionship; to part with is to relinquish possession; we
part from a person or from something thought of with some sense of companionship; a traveler parts from his
friends; he maybe said also to part from his native shore; a man parts with an estate, a horse, a copyright; part
with may be applied to a person thought of in any sense as a possession; an employer parts with a clerk or
servant; but part with is sometimes used by good writers as meaning simply to separate from.
* * * * *
PART, n.
Synonyms:
atom, fraction, member, section, component, fragment, particle, segment, constituent, ingredient, piece, share,
division, instalment, portion, subdivision. element,
Part, a substance, quantity, or amount that is the result of the division of something greater, is the general
word, including all the others of this group. A fragment is the result of breaking, rending, or disruption of
some kind, while a piece may be smoothly or evenly separated and have a certain completeness in itself. A
piece is often taken for a sample; a fragment scarcely would be. Division and fraction are always regarded as
in connection with the total; divisions may be equal or unequal; a fraction is one of several equal parts into
which the whole is supposed to be divided. A portion is a part viewed with reference to some one who is to
receive it or some special purpose to which it is to be applied; in a restaurant one portion (i. e., the amount
designed for one person) is sometimes, by special order, served to two; a share is a part to which one has or
may acquire a right in connection with others; an instalment is one of a series of proportionate payments that
are to be continued till the entire claim is discharged; a particle is an exceedingly small part. A component,
constituent, ingredient, or element is a part of some compound or mixture; an element is necessary to the
existence, as a component or constituent is necessary to the completeness of that which it helps to compose;
an ingredient may be foreign or accidental. A subdivision is a division of a division. We speak of a segment of
a circle. Compare PARTICLE; PORTION.

PARTICLE.
Synonyms:
atom, grain, mite, scrap, whit. corpuscle, iota, molecule, shred, element, jot, scintilla, tittle,
A particle is a very small part of any material substance; as, a particle of sand or of dust; it is a general term,
not accurately determinate in meaning. Atom (Gr. a- privative, not, and temno, cut) etymologically signifies
that which can not be cut or divided, and is the smallest conceivable particle of matter, regarded as absolutely
homogeneous and as having but one set of properties; atoms are the ultimate particles of matter. A molecule is
made up of atoms, and is regarded as separable into its constituent parts; as used by physicists, a molecule is
the smallest conceivable part which retains all the characteristics of the substance; thus, a molecule of water is
made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Element in chemistry denotes, without reference
to quantity, a substance regarded as simple, i. e., one incapable of being resolved by any known process into
simpler substances; the element gold may be represented by an ingot or by a particle of gold-dust. In popular
language, an element is any essential constituent; the ancients believed that the universe was made up of the
four elements, earth, air, fire, and water; a storm is spoken of as a manifestation of the fury of the elements.
We speak of corpuscles of blood. Compare PART.
Antonyms:
aggregate, entirety, mass, quantity, sum, sum total, total, whole.

PATIENCE.
Synonyms:
calmness, forbearance, long-suffering, sufferance. composure, fortitude, resignation, endurance, leniency,
submission,
Patience is the quality or habit of mind shown in bearing passively and uncomplainingly any pain, evil, or
hardship that may fall to one's lot. Endurance hardens itself against suffering, and may be merely stubborn;
fortitude is endurance animated by courage; endurance may by modifiers be made to have a passive force, as
when we speak of "passive endurance;" patience is not so hard as endurance nor so self-effacing as
submission. Submission is ordinarily and resignation always applied to matters of great moment, while
patience may apply to slight worries and annoyances. As regards our relations to our fellow men, forbearance
is abstaining from retaliation or revenge; patience is keeping kindliness of heart under vexatious conduct;
long-suffering is continued patience. Patience may also have an active force denoting uncomplaining
steadiness in doing, as in tilling the soil. Compare INDUSTRY.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ANGER.
Prepositions:
Patience in or amid sufferings; patience with (rarely toward) opposers or offenders; patience under afflictions;
(rarely) patience of heat or cold, etc.
* * * * *
PAY, n.
Synonyms:
allowance, hire, recompense, salary, compensation, honorarium, remuneration, stipend, earnings, payment,
requital, wages. fee,
An allowance is a stipulated amount furnished at regular intervals as a matter of discretion or gratuity, as of
food to besieged soldiers, or of money to a child or ward. Compensation is a comprehensive word signifying a
return for a service done. Remuneration is applied to matters of great amount or importance. Recompense is a
still wider and loftier word, with less suggestion of calculation and market value; there are services for which
affection and gratitude are the sole and sufficient recompense; earnings, fees, hire, pay, salary, and wages are
forms of compensation and may be included in compensation, remuneration, or recompense. Pay is
commercial and strictly signifies an exact pecuniary equivalent for a thing or service, except when the
contrary is expressly stated, as when we speak of "high pay" or "poor pay." Wages denotes what a worker
receives. Earnings is often used as exactly equivalent to wages, but may be used with reference to the real
value of work done or service rendered, and even applied to inanimate things; as, the earnings of capital. Hire
is distinctly mercenary or menial, but as a noun has gone out of popular use, tho the verb to hire is common.
Salary is for literary or professional work, wages for handicraft or other comparatively inferior service; a
salary is regarded as more permanent than wages; an editor receives a salary, a compositor receives wages.
Stipend has become exclusively a literary word. A fee is given for a single service or privilege, and is
sometimes in the nature of a gratuity. Compare REQUITE.
* * * * *
PEOPLE.
Synonyms:
commonwealth, nation, race, state, tribe. community, population,
A community is in general terms the aggregate of persons inhabiting any territory in common and viewed as
having common interests; a commonwealth is such a body of persons having a common government,
especially a republican government; as, the commonwealth of Massachusetts. A community may be very
small; a commonwealth is ordinarily of considerable extent. A people is the aggregate of any public
community, either in distinction from their rulers or as including them; a race is a division of mankind in the
line of origin and ancestry; the people of the United States includes members of almost every race. The use of
people as signifying persons collectively, as in the statement "The hall was full of people," has been severely
criticized, but is old and accepted English, and may fitly be classed as idiomatic, and often better than
persons, by reason of its collectivism. As Dean Alford suggests, it would make a strange transformation of the
old hymn "All people that on earth do dwell" to sing "All persons that on earth do dwell." A state is an
organized political community considered in its corporate capacity as "a body politic and corporate;" as, a
legislative act is the act of the state; every citizen is entitled to the protection of the state. A nation is an
organized political community considered with reference to the persons composing it as having certain definite
boundaries, a definite number of citizens, etc. The members of a people are referred to as persons or
individuals; the individual members of a state or nation are called citizens or subjects. The population of a
country is simply the aggregate of persons residing within its borders, without reference to race, organization,
or allegiance; unnaturalized residents form part of the population, but not of the nation, possessing none of the
rights and being subject to none of the duties of citizens. In American usage State signifies one commonwealth
of the federal union known as the United States. Tribe is now almost wholly applied to rude peoples with very
imperfect political organization; as, the Indian tribes; nomadic tribes. Compare MOB.
* * * * *
PERCEIVE.
Synonyms:
apprehend, comprehend, conceive, understand.
We perceive what is presented through the senses. We apprehend what is presented to the mind, whether
through the senses or by any other means. Yet perceive is used in the figurative sense of seeing through to a
conclusion, in a way for which usage would not allow us to substitute apprehend; as, "Sir, I perceive that thou
art a prophet," John iv, 19. That which we apprehend we catch, as with the hand; that which we conceive we
are able to analyze and recompose in our mind; that which we comprehend, we, as it were, grasp around, take
together, seize, embrace wholly within the mind. Many things may be apprehended which can not be
comprehended; a child can apprehend the distinction between right and wrong, yet the philosopher can not
comprehend it in its fulness. We can apprehend the will of God as revealed in conscience or the Scriptures;
we can conceive of certain attributes of Deity, as his truth and justice; but no finite intelligence can
comprehend the Divine Nature, in its majesty, power, and perfection. Compare ANTICIPATE; ARREST;
CATCH; KNOWLEDGE.
Antonyms:
fail of, ignore, lose, misapprehend, misconceive, miss, overlook.
* * * * *
PERFECT.
Synonyms:
absolute, consummate, holy, spotless, accurate, correct, ideal, stainless, blameless, entire, immaculate,
unblemished, complete, faultless, sinless, undefiled. completed, finished,
That is perfect to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken without impairing its
excellence, marring its symmetry, or detracting from its worth; in this fullest sense God alone is perfect, but in
a limited sense anything may be perfect in its kind; as a perfect flower; a copy of a document is perfect when
it is accurate in every particular; a vase may be called perfect when entire and unblemished, even tho not
artistically faultless; the best judges never pronounce a work of art perfect, because they see always ideal
possibilities not yet attained; even the ideal is not perfect, by reason of the imperfection of the human mind; a
human character faultlessly holy would be morally perfect tho finite. That which is absolute is free from
admixture (as absolute alcohol) and in the highest and fullest sense free from imperfection or limitation; as,
absolute holiness and love are attributes of God alone. In philosophical language, absolute signifies free from
all necessary, or even from all possible relations, not dependent or limited, unrelated and unconditioned; truth
immediately known, as intuitive truth, is absolute; God, as self-existent and free from all limitation or
dependence, is called the absolute Being, or simply the Absolute. Compare INNOCENT; INFINITE;
RADICAL.
Antonyms:
bad, defective, imperfect, meager, scant, blemished, deficient, incomplete, perverted, short, corrupt, deformed,
inferior, poor, spoiled, corrupted, fallible, insufficient, ruined, worthless. defaced, faulty, marred,
* * * * *
PERMANENT.
Synonyms:
abiding, enduring, lasting, steadfast, changeless, fixed, perpetual, unchangeable, constant, immutable,
persistent, unchanging. durable, invariable, stable,
Durable (L. durus, hard) is said almost wholly of material substances that resist wear; lasting is said of either
material or immaterial things. Permanent is a word of wider meaning; a thing is permanent which is not liable
to change; as, a permanent color; buildings upon a farm are called permanent improvements. Enduring is a
higher word, applied to that which resists both time and change; as, enduring fame.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for TRANSIENT.
* * * * *
PERMISSION.
Synonyms:
allowance, authorization, leave, license, authority, consent, liberty, permit.
Authority unites the right and power of control; age, wisdom, and character give authority to their possessor; a
book of learned research has authority, and is even called an authority. Permission justifies another in acting
without interference or censure, and usually implies some degree of approval. Authority gives a certain right
of control over all that may be affected by the action. There may be a failure to object, which constitutes an
implied permission, tho this is more properly expressed by allowance; we allow what we do not oppose,
permit what we expressly authorize. The noun permit implies a formal written permission. License is a formal
permission granted by competent authority to an individual to do some act or pursue some business which
would be or is made to be unlawful without such permission; as, a license to preach, to solemnize marriages,
or to sell intoxicating liquors. A license is permission granted rather than authority conferred; the sheriff has
authority (not permission nor license) to make an arrest. Consent is permission by the concurrence of wills in
two or more persons, a mutual approval or acceptance of something proposed. Compare ALLOW.
Antonyms:
denial, objection, prevention, refusal, resistance. hindrance, opposition, prohibition,
* * * * *
PERNICIOUS.
Synonyms:
bad, evil, mischievous, pestilential, baneful, foul, noisome, poisonous, deadly, harmful, noxious, ruinous,
deleterious, hurtful, perverting, unhealthful, destructive, injurious, pestiferous, unwholesome. detrimental,
insalubrious,
Pernicious (L. per, through, and neco, kill) signifies having the power of destroying or injuring, tending to
hurt or kill. Pernicious is stronger than injurious; that which is injurious is capable of doing harm; that which
is pernicious is likely to be destructive. Noxious (L. noceo, hurt) is a stronger word than noisome, as referring
to that which is injurious or destructive. Noisome now always denotes that which is extremely disagreeable or
disgusting, especially to the sense of smell; as, the noisome stench proclaimed the presence of noxious gases.
Antonyms:
advantageous, favorable, helpful, profitable, serviceable, beneficent, good, invigorating, rejuvenating, useful,
beneficial, healthful, life-giving, salutary, wholesome.
* * * * *
PERPLEXITY.
Synonyms:
amazement, bewilderment, distraction, doubt, astonishment, confusion, disturbance, embarrassment.
Perplexity (L. per, through, and plecto, plait) is the drawing or turning of the thoughts or faculties by turns in
different directions or toward contrasted or contradictory conclusions; confusion (L. confusus, from confundo,
pour together) is a state in which the mental faculties are, as it were, thrown into chaos, so that the clear and
distinct action of the different powers, as of perception, memory, reason, and will is lost; bewilderment is akin
to confusion, but is less overwhelming, and more readily recovered from; perplexity, accordingly, has not the
unsettling of the faculties implied in confusion, nor the overwhelming of the faculties implied in amazement
or astonishment; it is not the magnitude of the things to be known, but the want of full and definite
knowledge, that causes perplexity. The dividing of a woodland path may cause the traveler the greatest
perplexity, which may become bewilderment when he has tried one path after another and lost his bearings
completely. With an excitable person bewilderment may deepen into confusion that will make him unable to
think clearly or even to see or hear distinctly. Amazement results from the sudden and unimagined occurrence
of great good or evil or the sudden awakening of the mind to unthought-of truth. Astonishment often produces
bewilderment, which the word was formerly understood to imply. Compare AMAZEMENT; ANXIETY;
DOUBT.
* * * * *
PERSUADE.
Synonyms:
allure, dispose, incline, move, bring over, entice, induce, prevail on or upon, coax, impel, influence, urge,
convince, incite, lead, win over.
Of these words convince alone has no direct reference to moving the will, denoting an effect upon the
understanding only; one may be convinced of his duty without doing it, or he may be convinced of truth that
has no manifest connection with duty or action, as of a mathematical proposition. To persuade is to bring the
will of another to a desired decision by some influence exerted upon it short of compulsion; one may be
convinced that the earth is round; he may be persuaded to travel round it; but persuasion is so largely
dependent upon conviction that it is commonly held to be the orator's work first to convince in order that he
may persuade. Coax is a slighter word than persuade, seeking the same end by shallower methods, largely by
appeal to personal feeling, with or without success; as, a child coaxes a parent to buy him a toy. One may be
brought over, induced, or prevailed upon by means not properly included in persuasion, as by bribery or
intimidation; he is won over chiefly by personal influence. Compare INFLUENCE.
Antonyms:
deter, discourage, dissuade, hinder, hold back, repel, restrain.
* * * * *
PERTNESS.
Synonyms:
boldness, forwardness, liveliness, sprightliness. briskness, impertinence, sauciness, flippancy, impudence,
smartness,
Liveliness and sprightliness are pleasant and commendable; smartness is a limited and showy acuteness or
shrewdness, usually with unfavorable suggestion; pertness and sauciness are these qualities overdone, and
regardless of the respect due to superiors. Impertinence and impudence may be gross and stupid; pertness and
sauciness are always vivid and keen. Compare IMPUDENCE.
Antonyms:
bashfulness, demureness, diffidence, humility, modesty, shyness.
* * * * *
PERVERSE.
Synonyms:
contrary, froward, petulant, untoward, factious, intractable, stubborn, wayward, fractious, obstinate,
ungovernable, wilful.
Perverse (L. perversus, turned the wrong way) signifies wilfully wrong or erring, unreasonably set against
right, reason, or authority. The stubborn or obstinate person will not do what another desires or requires; the
perverse person will do anything contrary to what is desired or required of him. The petulant person frets, but
may comply; the perverse individual may be smooth or silent, but is wilfully intractable. Wayward refers to a
perverse disregard of morality and duty; froward is practically obsolete; untoward is rarely heard except in
certain phrases; as, untoward circumstances. Compare OBSTINATE.
Antonyms:
accommodating, complaisant, genial, kind, amenable, compliant, governable, obliging.
* * * * *
PHYSICAL.
Synonyms:
bodily, corporeal, natural, tangible, corporal, material, sensible, visible.
Whatever is composed of or pertains to matter may be termed material; physical (Gr. physis, nature) applies
to material things considered as parts of a system or organic whole; hence, we speak of material substances,
physical forces, physical laws. Bodily, corporal, and corporeal apply primarily to the human body; bodily and
corporal both denote pertaining or relating to the body; corporeal signifies of the nature of or like the body;
corporal is now almost wholly restricted to signify applied to or inflicted upon the body; we speak of bodily
sufferings, bodily presence, corporal punishment, the corporeal frame.
Antonyms:
hyperphysical, intangible, invisible, moral, unreal, immaterial, intellectual, mental, spiritual, unsubstantial.
* * * * *
PIQUE.
Synonyms:
displeasure, irritation, offense, resentment, umbrage. grudge,
Pique, from the French, signifies primarily a prick or a sting, as of a nettle; the word denotes a sudden feeling
of mingled pain and anger, but slight and usually transient, arising from some neglect or offense, real or
imaginary. Umbrage is a deeper and more persistent displeasure at being overshadowed (L. umbra, a shadow)
or subjected to any treatment that one deems unworthy of him. It may be said, as a general statement, that
pique arises from wounded vanity or sensitiveness, umbrage from wounded pride or sometimes from
suspicion. Resentment rests on more solid grounds, and is deep and persistent. Compare ANGER.
Antonyms:
approval, contentment, gratification, pleasure, satisfaction. complacency, delight,
* * * * *
PITIFUL.
Synonyms:
abject, lamentable, paltry, sorrowful, base, miserable, pathetic, touching, contemptible, mournful, piteous,
woful, despicable, moving, pitiable, wretched.
Pitiful originally signified full of pity; as, "the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy," James v, 11; but this
usage is now archaic, and the meaning in question is appropriated by such words as merciful and
compassionate. Pitiful and pitiable now refer to what may be deserving of pity, pitiful being used chiefly for
that which is merely an object of thought, pitiable for that which is brought directly before the senses; as, a
pitiful story; a pitiable object; a pitiable condition. Since pity, however, always implies weakness or
inferiority in that which is pitied, pitiful and pitiable are often used, by an easy transition, for what might
awaken pity, but does awaken contempt; as, a pitiful excuse; he presented a pitiable appearance. Piteous is
now rarely used in its earlier sense of feeling pity, but in its derived sense applies to what really excites the
emotion; as, a piteous cry. Compare HUMANE; MERCY; PITY.
Antonyms:
august, dignified, grand, lofty, sublime, beneficent, exalted, great, mighty, superb, commanding, glorious,
helpful, noble, superior.
* * * * *
PITY.
Synonyms:
commiseration, condolence, sympathy, tenderness. compassion, mercy,
Pity is a feeling of grief or pain aroused by the weakness, misfortunes, or distresses of others, joined with a
desire to help or relieve. Sympathy (feeling or suffering with) implies some degree of equality, kindred, or
union; pity is for what is weak or unfortunate, and so far, at least, inferior to ourselves; hence, pity is often
resented where sympathy would be welcome. We have sympathy with one in joy or grief, in pleasure or pain,
pity only for those in suffering or need; we may have sympathy with the struggles of a giant or the triumphs of
a conqueror; we are moved with pity for the captive or the slave. Pity may be only in the mind, but mercy does
something for those who are its objects. Compassion, like pity, is exercised only with respect to the suffering
or unfortunate, but combines with the tenderness of pity the dignity of sympathy and the active quality of
mercy. Commiseration is as tender as compassion, but more remote and hopeless; we have commiseration for
sufferers whom we can not reach or can not relieve. Condolence is the expression of sympathy. Compare
MERCY.
Antonyms:
barbarity, ferocity, harshness, pitilessness, severity, brutality, hard-heartedness, inhumanity, rigor, sternness,
cruelty, hardness, mercilessness, ruthlessness, truculence.
Prepositions:
Pity on or upon that which we help or spare; pity for that which we merely contemplate; "have pity upon me,
O ye my friends," Job xix, 21; "pity for a horse o'erdriven," TENNYSON In Memoriam lxii, st. 1.
* * * * *
PLANT.
Synonyms:
seed, seed down, set, set out, sow.
We set or set out slips, cuttings, young trees, etc., tho we may also be said to plant them; we plant corn,
potatoes, etc., which we put in definite places, as in hills, with some care; we sow wheat or other small grains
and seeds which are scattered in the process. Tho by modern agricultural machinery the smaller grains are
almost as precisely planted as corn, the old word for broadcast scattering is retained. Land is seeded or seeded
down to grass.
Antonyms:
eradicate, extirpate, root up, uproot, weed out.
* * * * *
PLEAD.
Synonyms:
advocate, ask, beseech, implore, solicit, argue, beg, entreat, press, urge.
To plead for one is to employ argument or persuasion, or both in his behalf, usually with earnestness or
importunity; similarly one may be said to plead for himself or for a cause, etc., or with direct object, to plead
a case; in legal usage, pleading is argumentative, but in popular usage, pleading always implies some appeal
to the feelings. One argues a case solely on rational grounds and supposably with fair consideration of both
sides; he advocates one side for the purpose of carrying it, and under the influence of motives that may range
all the way from cold self-interest to the highest and noblest impulses; he pleads a cause, or pleads for a
person with still more intense feeling. Beseech, entreat, and implore imply impassioned earnestness, with
direct and tender appeal to personal considerations. Press and urge imply more determined or perhaps
authoritative insistence. Solicit is a weak word denoting merely an attempt to secure one's consent or
cooperation, sometimes by sordid or corrupt motives.
Prepositions:
Plead with the tyrant for the captive; plead against the oppression or the oppressor; plead to the indictment; at
the bar; before the court; in open court.
* * * * *
PLEASANT.
Synonyms:
agreeable, good-natured, kindly, pleasing, attractive, kind, obliging, pleasurable.
That is pleasing from which pleasure is received, or may readily be received, without reference to any action
or intent in that which confers it; as, a pleasing picture; a pleasing landscape. Whatever has active qualities
adapted to give pleasure is pleasant; as, a pleasant breeze; a pleasant (not a pleasing) day. As applied to
persons, pleasant always refers to a disposition ready and desirous to please; one is pleasant, or in a pleasant
mood, when inclined to make happy those with whom he is dealing, to show kindness and do any reasonable
favor. In this sense pleasant is nearly akin to kind, but kind refers to act or intent, while pleasant stops with
the disposition; many persons are no longer in a pleasant mood if asked to do a troublesome kindness.
Pleasant keeps always something of the sense of actually giving pleasure, and thus surpasses the meaning of
good-natured; there are good-natured people who by reason of rudeness and ill-breeding are not pleasant
companions. A pleasing face has good features, complexion, expression, etc.; a pleasant face indicates a kind
heart and an obliging disposition, as well as kindly feelings in actual exercise; we can say of one usually
good-natured, "on that occasion he did not meet me with a pleasant face." Pleasant, in the sense of gay,
merry, jocose (the sense still retained in pleasantry), is now rare, and would not be understood outside of
literary circles. Compare AMIABLE; COMFORTABLE; DELIGHTFUL.
Antonyms:
arrogant, displeasing, glum, ill-humored, repelling, austere, dreary, grim, ill-natured, repulsive, crabbed,
forbidding, harsh, offensive, unkind, disagreeable, gloomy, hateful, repellent, unpleasant.
Prepositions:
Pleasant to, with, or toward persons, about a matter.
* * * * *
PLENTIFUL.
Synonyms:
abounding, bountiful, generous, plenteous, abundant, complete, large, profuse, adequate, copious, lavish,
replete, affluent, enough, liberal, rich, ample, exuberant, luxuriant, sufficient, bounteous, full, overflowing,
teeming.
Enough is relative, denoting a supply equal to a given demand. A temperature of 70 Fahrenheit is enough for
a living-room; of 212 enough to boil water; neither is enough to melt iron. Sufficient, from the Latin, is an
equivalent of the Saxon enough, with no perceptible difference of meaning, but only of usage, enough being
the more blunt, homely, and forcible word, while sufficient is in many cases the more elegant or polite.
Sufficient usually precedes its noun; enough usually and preferably follows. That is ample which gives a safe,
but not a large, margin beyond a given demand; that is abundant, affluent, bountiful, liberal, plentiful, which
is largely in excess of manifest need. Plentiful is used of supplies, as of food, water, etc.; as, "a plentiful rain,"
Ps. lxviii, 9. We may also say a copious rain; but copious can be applied to thought, language, etc., where
plentiful can not well be used. Affluent and liberal both apply to riches, resources; liberal, with especial
reference to giving or expending. (Compare synonyms for ADEQUATE.) Affluent, referring especially to
riches, may be used of thought, feeling, etc. Neither affluent, copious, nor plentiful can be used of time or
space; a field is sometimes called plentiful, not with reference to its extent, but to its productiveness. Complete
expresses not excess or overplus, and yet not mere sufficiency, but harmony, proportion, fitness to a design, or
ideal. Ample and abundant may be applied to any subject. We have time enough, means that we can reach our
destination without haste, but also without delay; if we have ample time, we may move leisurely, and note
what is by the way; if we have abundant time, we may pause to converse with a friend, to view the scenery, or
to rest when weary. Lavish and profuse imply a decided excess, oftenest in the ill sense. We rejoice in
abundant resources, and honor generous hospitality; lavish or profuse expenditure suggests extravagance and
wastefulness. Luxuriant is used especially of that which is abundant in growth; as, a luxuriant crop.
Antonyms:
deficient, inadequate, narrow, scanty, small, drained, insufficient, niggardly, scarce, sparing, exhausted, mean,
poor, scrimped, stingy, impoverished, miserly, scant, short, straitened.
Preposition:
Plentiful in resources.
* * * * *
POETRY.
Synonyms:
meter, numbers, poesy, song, metrical composition, poem, rime, verse.
Poetry is that form of literature that embodies beautiful thought, feeling, or action in melodious, rhythmical,
and (usually) metrical language, in imaginative and artistic constructions. Poetry in a very wide sense may be
anything that pleasingly addresses the imagination; as, the poetry of motion. In ordinary usage, poetry is both
imaginative and metrical. There may be poetry without rime, but hardly without meter, or what in some
languages takes its place, as the Hebrew parallelism; but poetry involves, besides the artistic form, the
exercise of the fancy or imagination in a way always beautiful, often lofty or even sublime. Failing this, there
may be verse, rime, and meter, but not poetry. There is much in literature that is beautiful and sublime in
thought and artistic in construction, which is yet not poetry, because quite devoid of the element of song,
whereby poetry differs from the most lofty, beautiful, or impassioned prose. Compare METER.
Antonyms:
prosaic speech, prosaic writing, prose.
* * * * *
POLITE.
Synonyms:
accomplished, courtly, genteel, urbane, civil, cultivated, gracious, well-behaved, complaisant, cultured,
obliging, well-bred, courteous, elegant, polished, well-mannered.
A civil person observes such propriety of speech and manner as to avoid being rude; one who is polite
(literally polished) observes more than the necessary proprieties, conforming to all that is graceful, becoming,
and thoughtful in the intercourse of refined society. A man may be civil with no consideration for others,
simply because self-respect forbids him to be rude; but one who is polite has at least some care for the
opinions of others, and if polite in the highest and truest sense, which is coming to be the prevailing one, he
cares for the comfort and happiness of others in the smallest matters. Civil is a colder and more distant word
than polite; courteous is fuller and richer, dealing often with greater matters, and is used only in the good
sense. Courtly suggests that which befits a royal court, and is used of external grace and stateliness without
reference to the prompting feeling; as, the courtly manners of the ambassador. Genteel refers to an external
elegance, which may be showy and superficial, and the word is thus inferior to polite or courteous. Urbane
refers to a politeness that is genial and successful in giving others a sense of ease and cheer. Polished refers to
external elegancies of speech and manner without reference to spirit or purpose; as, a polished gentleman or a
polished scoundrel; cultured refers to a real and high development of mind and soul, of which the external
manifestation is the smallest part. Complaisant denotes a disposition to please or favor beyond what
politeness would necessarily require.
Antonyms:
awkward, clownish, ill-mannered, insulting, uncouth, bluff, coarse, impertinent, raw, unmannerly, blunt,
discourteous, impolite, rude, unpolished, boorish, ill-behaved, impudent, rustic, untaught, brusk, ill-bred,
insolent, uncivil, untutored.
* * * * *
POLITY.
Synonyms:
constitution, policy, form or system of government.
Polity is the permanent system of government of a state, a church, or a society; policy is the method of
management with reference to the attainment of certain ends; the national polity of the United States is
republican; each administration has a policy of its own. Policy is often used as equivalent to expediency; as,
many think honesty to be good policy. Polity used in ecclesiastical use serves a valuable purpose in
distinguishing that which relates to administration and government from that which relates to faith and
doctrine; two churches identical in faith may differ in polity, or those agreeing in polity may differ in faith.
Compare LAW.
* * * * *
PORTION.
Synonyms:
lot, parcel, part, proportion, share.
When any whole is divided into parts, any part that is allotted to some person, thing, subject or purpose is
called a portion, tho the division may be by no fixed rule or relation; a father may divide his estate by will
among his children so as to make their several portions great or small, according to his arbitrary and
unreasonable caprice. When we speak of a part as a proportion, we think of the whole as divided according to
some rule or scale, so that the different parts bear a contemplated and intended relation or ratio to one another;
thus, the portion allotted to a child by will may not be a fair proportion of the estate. Proportion is often used
where part or portion would be more appropriate. Compare PART.
* * * * *
POVERTY.
Synonyms:
beggary, distress, mendicancy, pauperism, privation, destitution, indigence, need, penury, want.
Poverty denotes strictly lack of property or adequate means of support, but in common use is a relative term
denoting any condition below that of easy, comfortable living; privation denotes a condition of painful lack of
what is useful or desirable, tho not to the extent of absolute distress; indigence is lack of ordinary means of
subsistence; destitution is lack of the comforts, and in part even of the necessaries of life; penury is especially
cramping poverty, possibly not so sharp as destitution, but continuous, while that may be temporary;
pauperism is such destitution as throws one upon organized public charity for support; beggary and
mendicancy denote poverty that appeals for indiscriminate private charity.

POWER.
Synonyms:
ability, competency, expertness, readiness, aptitude, dexterity, faculty, skill, capability, efficacy, force,
strength, capacity, efficiency, might, susceptibility, cleverness, energy, qualification, talent. cogency,
Power is the most general term of this group, including every quality, property, or faculty by which any
change, effect, or result is, or may be, produced; as, the power of the legislature to enact laws, or of the
executive to enforce them; the power of an acid to corrode a metal; the power of a polished surface to reflect
light. Ability is nearly coextensive with power, but does not reach the positiveness and vigor that may be
included in the meaning of power, ability often implying latent, as distinguished from active power; we speak
of an exertion of power, but not of an exertion of ability. Power and ability include capacity, which is power
to receive; but ability is often distinguished from capacity, as power that may be manifested in doing, as
capacity is in receiving; one may have great capacity for acquiring knowledge, and yet not possess ability to
teach. Efficiency is active power to effect a definite result, the power that actually does, as distinguished from
that which may do. Competency is equal to the occasion, readiness prompt for the occasion. Faculty is an
inherent quality of mind or body; talent, some special mental ability. Dexterity and skill are readiness and
facility in action, having a special end; talent is innate, dexterity and skill are largely acquired. Our abilities
include our natural capacity, faculties, and talents, with all the dexterity, skill, and readiness that can be
acquired. Efficacy is the power to produce an intended effect as shown in the production of it; as, the efficacy
of a drug. Efficiency is effectual agency, competent power; efficiency is applied in mechanics as denoting the
ratio of the effect produced to the power expended in producing it; but this word is chiefly used of intelligent
agents as denoting the quality that brings all one's power to bear promptly and to the best purpose on the thing
to be done. Compare ADDRESS; DEXTERITY; SKILFUL.
Antonyms:
awkwardness, helplessness, inability, incompetence, stupidity, dulness, imbecility, inaptitude, inefficiency,
unskilfulness, feebleness, impotence, incapacity, maladroitness, weakness.
* * * * *
PRAISE.
Synonyms:
acclaim, approbation, compliment, laudation, acclamation, approval, encomium, panegyric, adulation,
cheering, eulogy, plaudit, applause, cheers, flattery, sycophancy.
Praise is the hearty approval of an individual, or of a number or multitude considered individually, and is
expressed by spoken or written words; applause, the spontaneous outburst of many at once. Applause is
expressed in any way, by stamping of feet, clapping of hands, waving of handkerchiefs, etc., as well as by the
voice; acclamation is the spontaneous and hearty approval of many at once, and strictly by the voice alone.
Thus one is chosen moderator by acclamation when he receives a unanimous viva voce vote; we could not say
he was nominated by applause. Acclaim is the more poetic term for acclamation, commonly understood in a
loftier sense; as, a nation's acclaim. Plaudit is a shout of applause, and is commonly used in the plural; as, the
plaudits of a throng. Applause is also used in the general sense of praise. Approbation is a milder and more
qualified word than praise; while praise is always uttered, approbation may be silent. "Approbation speaks of
the thing or action.... Praise is always personal." A. W. AND J. C. HARE Guesses at Truth first series, p. 549.
[MACM. '66.] Acceptance refers to an object or action; approbation may refer to character or natural traits.
Approval always supposes a testing or careful examination, and frequently implies official sanction;
approbation may be upon a general view. The industry and intelligence of a clerk win his employer's
approbation; his decision in a special instance receives his approval. Praise is always understood as genuine
and sincere, unless the contrary is expressly stated; compliment is a light form of praise that may or may not
be sincere; flattery is insincere and ordinarily fulsome praise.
Antonyms:
abuse, contempt, hissing, repudiation, animadversion, denunciation, ignominy, scorn, blame, disapprobation,
obloquy, slander, censure, disapproval, reproach, vilification, condemnation, disparagement, reproof,
vituperation.
* * * * *
PRAY.
Synonyms:
ask, bid, entreat, invoke, request, beg, call upon, implore, petition, supplicate. beseech, conjure, importune,
plead,
To pray, in the religious sense, is devoutly to address the Supreme Being with reverent petition for divine
grace or any favor or blessing, and in the fullest sense with thanksgiving and praise for the divine goodness
and mercy; the once common use of the word to express any earnest request, as "I pray you to come in," is
now rare, unless in writings molded on older literature, or in certain phrases, as "Pray sit down;" even in these
"please" is more common; "I beg you" is also frequently used, as expressing a polite humility of request.
Beseech and entreat express great earnestness of petition; implore and supplicate denote the utmost fervency
and intensity, supplicate implying also humility. Compare ASK; PLEAD.
* * * * *
PRECARIOUS.
Synonyms:
doubtful, hazardous, risky, unsettled, dubious, insecure, unassured, unstable, equivocal, perilous, uncertain,
unsteady.
Uncertain is applied to things that human knowledge can not certainly determine or that human power can not
certainly control; precarious originally meant dependent on the will of another, and now, by extension of
meaning, dependent on chance or hazard, with manifest unfavorable possibility verging toward probability;
as, one holds office by a precarious tenure, or land by a precarious title; the strong man's hold on life is
uncertain, the invalid's is precarious.
Antonyms:
actual, immutable, real, steady, undeniable, assured, incontestable, settled, strong, undoubted, certain,
infallible, stable, sure, unquestionable. firm,
* * * * *
PRECEDENT.
Synonyms:
antecedent, case, instance, pattern, authority, example, obiter dictum, warrant.
A precedent is an authoritative case, example, or instance. The communism of the early Christians in
Jerusalem is a wonderful example or instance of Christian liberality, but not a precedent for the universal
church through all time. Cases decided by irregular or unauthorized tribunals are not precedents for the
regular administration of law. An obiter dictum is an opinion outside of the case in hand, which can not be
quoted as an authoritative precedent. Compare CAUSE; EXAMPLE.
* * * * *
PREDESTINATION.
Synonyms:
fate, foreknowledge, foreordination, necessity.
Predestination is a previous determination or decision, which, in the divine action, reaches on from eternity.
Fate is heathen, an irresistible, irrational power determining all events with no manifest connection with
reason or righteousness; necessity is philosophical, a blind something in the nature of things binding the
slightest action or motion in the chain of inevitable, eternal sequence; foreordination and predestination are
Christian, denoting the rational and righteous order or decree of the supreme and all-wise God.
Foreknowledge is simply God's antecedent knowledge of all events, which some hold to be entirely separable
from his foreordination, while others hold foreordination to be inseparably involved in foreknowledge.
Antonyms:
accident, choice, freedom, independence, chance, free agency, free will, uncertainty.
Prepositions:
Predestination of believers to eternal life.
* * * * *
PREJUDICE.
Synonyms:
bias, preconception, presumption, partiality, prepossession, unfairness.
A presumption (literally, a taking beforehand) is a partial decision formed in advance of argument or
evidence, usually grounded on some general principle, and always held subject to revision upon fuller
information. A prejudice or prepossession is grounded often on feeling, fancy, associations, etc. A prejudice
against foreigners is very common in retired communities. There is always a presumption in favor of what
exists, so that the burden of proof is upon one who advocates a change. A prepossession is always favorable, a
prejudice always unfavorable, unless the contrary is expressly stated. Compare INJURY.
Antonyms:
certainty, conviction, evidence, reason, conclusion, demonstration, proof, reasoning.
Prepositions:
Against; rarely, in favor of, in one's favor.
* * * * *
PRETENSE.
Synonyms:
affectation, disguise, pretext, simulation, air, dissimulation, ruse, subterfuge, assumption, excuse, seeming,
trick, cloak, mask, semblance, wile. color, pretension, show,
A pretense, in the unfavorable, which is also the usual sense, is something advanced or displayed for the
purpose of concealing the reality. A person makes a pretense of something for the credit or advantage to be
gained by it; he makes what is allowed or approved a pretext for doing what would be opposed or condemned;
a tricky schoolboy makes a pretense of doing an errand which he does not do, or he makes the actual doing of
an errand a pretext for playing truant. A ruse is something (especially something slight or petty) employed to
blind or deceive so as to mask an ulterior design, and enable a person to gain some end that he would not be
allowed to approach directly. A pretension is a claim that is or may be contested; the word is now commonly
used in an unfavorable sense. Compare ARTIFICE; HYPOCRISY.
Antonyms:
actuality, frankness, ingenuousness, reality, sincerity, candor, guilelessness, openness, simplicity, truth. fact,
honesty,
* * * * *
PREVENT.
Synonyms:
anticipate, forestall, obviate, preclude.
The original sense of prevent, to come before, act in advance of, which is now practically obsolete, was still in
good use when the authorized version of the Bible was made, as appears in such passages as, "When Peter
was come into the house, Jesus prevented him" (i. e., addressed him first), Matt. xvii, 25; "Thou preventest
him with the blessings of goodness" (i. e., by sending the blessings before the desire is formulated or
expressed), Ps. xxi, 3. Anticipate is now the only single word usable in this sense; to forestall is to take or act
in advance in one's own behalf and to the prejudice of another or others, as in the phrase "to forestall the
market." But to anticipate is very frequently used in the favorable sense; as, his thoughtful kindness
anticipated my wish (i. e., met the wish before it was expressed): or we say, "I was about to accost him when
he anticipated me" (by speaking first); or one anticipates a payment (by making it before the time); in neither
of these cases could we use forestall or prevent. To obviate (literally, to stop the way of or remove from the
way), is to prevent by interception, so that something that would naturally withstand or disturb may be kept
from doing so; to preclude, (literally, to close or shut in advance) is to prevent by anticipation or by logical
necessity; walls and bars precluded the possibility of escape; a supposition is precluded; a necessity or
difficulty is obviated. Prevent, which at first had only the anticipatory meaning, has come to apply to the
stopping of an action at any stage, the completion or conclusion only being thought of as negatived by
anticipation; the enemy passed the outworks and were barely prevented from capturing the fortress. Compare
HINDER; PROHIBIT.
Preposition:
He was prevented by illness from joining the expedition.
* * * * *
PREVIOUS.
Synonyms:
antecedent, foregoing, front, preceding, anterior, former, introductory, preliminary, earlier, forward,
precedent, prior.
Antecedent may denote simple priority in time, implying no direct connection between that which goes before
and that which follows; as, the striking of one clock may be always antecedent to the striking of another with
no causal connection between them. Antecedent and previous may refer to that which goes or happens at any
distance in advance, preceding is limited to that which is immediately or next before; an antecedent event may
have happened at any time before; the preceding transaction is the one completed just before the one with
which it is compared; a previous statement or chapter may be in any part of the book that has gone before; the
preceding statement or chapter comes next before without an interval. Previous often signifies first by right;
as, a previous engagement. Foregoing is used only of that which is spoken or written; as, the foregoing
statements. Anterior, while it can be used of time, is coming to be employed chiefly with reference to place; as
the anterior lobes of the brain. Prior bears exclusive reference to time, and commonly where that which is
first in time is first also in right; as, a prior demand. Former is used of time, or of position in written or
printed matter, not of space in general. We can say former times, a former chapter, etc., but not the former part
of a garden; we should say the front part of the garden, the forward car of a train. Former has a close relation,
or sharp contrast, with something following; the former always implies the latter, even when not fully
expressed, as in Acts i, 1, and Eccles. vii, 10.
Antonyms:
after, consequent, hind, hindmost, latter, subsequent, concluding, following, hinder, later, posterior,
succeeding.
Preposition:
Such was the state of things previous to the revolution. [Previous to is often used adverbially, in constructions
where previously to would be more strictly correct; as, these arrangements were made previous to my
departure.]
* * * * *
PRICE.
Synonyms:
charge, cost, expenditure, expense, outlay, value, worth.
The cost of a thing is all that has been expended upon it, whether in discovery, production, refinement,
decoration, transportation, or otherwise, to bring it to its present condition in the hands of its present
possessor; the price of a thing is what the seller asks for it. In regular business, as a rule, the seller's price on
his wares must be more than their cost to him; when goods are sold, the price the buyer has paid becomes
their cost to himself. In exceptional cases, when goods are sold at cost, the seller's price is made the same as
the cost of the goods to him, the cost to the seller and the cost to the buyer becoming then identical. Price
always implies that an article is for sale; what a man will not sell he declines to put a price on; hence the
significance of the taunting proverb that "every man has his price." Value is the estimated equivalent for an
article, whether the article is for sale or not; the market value is what it would bring if exposed for sale in the
open market; the intrinsic value is the inherent utility of the article considered by itself alone; the market value
of an old and rare volume may be very great, while its intrinsic value may be practically nothing. Value has
always more reference to others' estimation (literally, what the thing will avail with others) than worth, which
regards the thing in and by itself; thus, intrinsic value is a weaker expression than intrinsic worth. Charge has
especial reference to services, expense to minor outlays; as, the charges of a lawyer or physician; traveling
expenses; household expenses.
* * * * *
PRIDE.
Synonyms:
arrogance, ostentation, self-exaltation, assumption, presumption, self-respect, conceit, reserve,
superciliousness, disdain, self-complacency, vainglory, haughtiness, self-conceit, vanity. insolence,
self-esteem,
Haughtiness thinks highly of itself and poorly of others. Arrogance claims much for itself and concedes little
to others. Pride is an absorbing sense of one's own greatness; haughtiness feels one's own superiority to
others; disdain sees contemptuously the inferiority of others to oneself. Presumption claims place or privilege
above one's right; pride deems nothing too high. Insolence is open and rude expression of contempt and
hostility, generally from an inferior to a superior, as from a servant to a master or mistress. In the presence of
superiors overweening pride manifests itself in presumption or insolence; in the presence of inferiors, or those
supposed to be inferior, pride manifests itself by arrogance, disdain, haughtiness, superciliousness, or in
either case often by cold reserve. (See RESERVE under MODESTY.) Pride is too self-satisfied to care for
praise; vanity intensely craves admiration and applause. Superciliousness, as if by the uplifted eyebrow, as its
etymology suggests (L. supercilium, eyebrow, from super, over and cilium, eyelid), silently manifests mingled
haughtiness and disdain. Assumption quietly takes for granted superiority and privilege which others would be
slow to concede. Conceit and vanity are associated with weakness, pride with strength. Conceit may be
founded upon nothing; pride is founded upon something that one is, or has, or has done; vanity, too, is
commonly founded on something real, tho far slighter than would afford foundation for pride. Vanity is eager
for admiration and praise, is elated if they are rendered, and pained if they are withheld, and seeks them; pride
could never solicit admiration or praise. Conceit is somewhat stronger than self-conceit. Self-conceit is
ridiculous; conceit is offensive. Self-respect is a thoroughly worthy feeling; self-esteem is a more generous
estimate of one's own character and abilities than the rest of the world are ready to allow. Vainglory is more
pompous and boastful than vanity. Compare EGOTISM; OSTENTATION.
Antonyms:
humility, meekness, modesty, self-abasement, self-distrust. lowliness,
* * * * *
PRIMEVAL.
Synonyms:
aboriginal, indigenous, patriarchal, primitive, ancient, native, primal, primordial, autochthonic, old, primary,
pristine, immemorial, original, prime, uncreated.
Aboriginal (L. ab, from, origo, origin) signifies pertaining to the aborigines or earliest known inhabitants of a
country in the widest sense, including not merely human beings but inferior animals and plants as well.
Autochthonic (Gr. autos, self, and chth[=o]n, earth) signifies sprung from the earth, especially from the soil of
one's native land. Primeval (L. primum, first, and vum, age), signifies strictly belonging to the first ages,
earliest in time, but often only the earliest of which man knows or conceives, immemorial. Aboriginal,
autochthonic, and primeval combine the meanings of ancient and original; aboriginal inhabitants,
autochthonic races, primeval forests. Prime and primary may signify either first in time, or more frequently
first in importance; primary has also the sense of elementary or preparatory; we speak of a prime minister, a
primary school. Primal is chiefly poetic, in the sense of prime; as, the primal curse. Primordial is first in an
order of succession or development; as, a primordial leaf. Primitive frequently signifies having the original
characteristics of that which it represents, as well as standing first in time; as, the primitive church. Primitive
also very frequently signifies having the original or early characteristics without remoteness in time. Primeval
simplicity is the simplicity of the earliest ages; primitive simplicity may be found in retired villages now.
Pristine is an elegant word, used almost exclusively in a good sense of that which is original and perhaps
ancient; as, pristine purity, innocence, vigor. That which is both an original and natural product of a soil or
country is said to be indigenous; that which is actually produced there is said to be native, though it may be of
foreign extraction; humming-birds are indigenous to America; canaries may be native, but are not indigenous.
Immemorial refers solely to time, independently of quality, denoting, in legal phrase, "that whereof the
memory of man runneth not to the contrary;" as, an immemorial custom; an immemorial abuse. Compare
OLD.
Antonyms:
adventitious, foreign, late, new, recent. exotic, fresh, modern, novel,
Compare synonyms for NEW.
* * * * *
PROFIT.
Synonyms:
advantage, expediency, proceeds, service, avail, gain, receipts, usefulness, benefit, good, return, utility,
emolument, improvement, returns, value.
The returns or receipts include all that is received from an outlay or investment; the profit is the excess (if
any) of the receipts over the outlay; hence, in government, morals, etc., the profit is what is really good,
helpful, useful, valuable. Utility is chiefly used in the sense of some immediate or personal and generally
some material good. Advantage is that which gives one a vantage-ground, either for coping with competitors
or with difficulties, needs, or demands; as to have the advantage of a good education; it is frequently used of
what one has beyond another or secures at the expense of another; as, to have the advantage of another in an
argument, or to take advantage of another in a bargain. Gain is what one secures beyond what he previously
possessed. Benefit is anything that does one good. Emolument is profit, return, or value accruing through
official position. Expediency has respect to profit or advantage, real or supposed, considered apart from or
perhaps in opposition to right, in actions having a moral character. Compare UTILITY.
Antonyms:
damage, detriment, harm, injury, ruin, destruction, disadvantage, hurt, loss, waste.
Prepositions:
The profit of labor; on capital; in business.
* * * * *
PROGRESS.
Synonyms:
advance, development, improvement, proficiency, advancement, growth, increase, progression. attainment,
Progress (L. pro, forward, gradior, go) is a moving onward or forward, whether in space or in the mental or
moral realm, and may be either mechanical, individual, or social. Attainment, development, and proficiency
are more absolute than the other words of the group, denoting some point of advantage or of comparative
perfection reached by forward or onward movement; we speak of attainments in virtue or scholarship,
proficiency in music or languages, the development of new powers or organs; proficiency includes the idea of
skill. Advance may denote either a forward movement or the point gained by forward movement, but always
relatively with reference to the point from which the movement started; as, this is a great advance. Advance
admits the possibility of retreat; progress (L. progredi, to walk forward) is steady and constant forward
movement, admitting of pause, but not of retreat; advance suggests more clearly a point to be reached, while
progress lays the emphasis upon the forward movement; we may speak of slow or rapid progress, but more
naturally of swift advance. Progress is more frequently used of abstractions; as, the progress of ideas;
progression fixes the attention chiefly upon the act of moving forward. In a thing good in itself all advance or
progress is improvement; there is a growing tendency to restrict the words to this favorable sense, using
increase indifferently of good or evil; one may say without limitation, "I am an advocate of progress."
Antonyms:
check, delay, falling off, retrogression, stop, decline, falling back, relapse, stay, stoppage.
Prepositions:
The progress of truth; progress in virtue; toward perfection; from a lower to a higher state.
* * * * *
PROHIBIT.
Synonyms:
debar, forbid, inhibit, preclude, disallow, hinder, interdict, prevent.
To prohibit is to give some formal command against, and especially to make some authoritative legal
enactment against. Debar is said of persons, disallow of acts; one is debarred from anything when shut off, as
by some irresistible authority or necessity; one is prohibited from an act in express terms; he may be debarred
by silent necessity. An act is disallowed by the authority that might have allowed it; the word is especially
applied to acts which are done before they are pronounced upon; thus, a government may disallow the act of
its commander in the field or its admiral on the high seas. Inhibit and interdict are chiefly known by their
ecclesiastical use. As between forbid and prohibit, forbid is less formal and more personal, prohibit more
official and judicial, with the implication of readiness to use such force as may be needed to give effect to the
enactment; a parent forbids a child to take part in some game or to associate with certain companions; the
slave-trade is now prohibited by the leading nations of the world. Many things are prohibited by law which
can not be wholly prevented, as gambling and prostitution; on the other hand, things may be prevented which
are not prohibited, as the services of religion, the payment of debts, or military conquest. That which is
precluded need not be prohibited. Compare ABOLISH; HINDER; PREVENT.
Antonyms:
allow, empower, let, require, authorize, enjoin, license, sanction, command, give consent, order, suffer,
consent to, give leave, permit, tolerate, direct, give permission, put up with, warrant.
Prepositions:
An act is prohibited by law; a person is prohibited by law from doing a certain act. Prohibit was formerly
construed, as forbid still is, with the infinitive, but the construction with from and the verbal noun has now
entirely superseded the older usage.
* * * * *
PROMOTE.
Synonyms:
advance, encourage, forward, prefer, raise, aid, exalt, foster, push, urge forward, assist, excite, further, push
on, urge on. elevate, foment, help,
To promote (L. pro, forward, and moveo, move) is to cause to move forward toward some desired end or to
raise to some higher position, rank, or dignity. We promote a person by advancing, elevating, or exalting him
to a higher position or dignity. A person promotes a scheme or an enterprise which others have projected or
begun, and which he encourages, forwards, furthers, pushes, or urges on, especially when he acts as the agent
of the prime movers and supporters of the enterprise. One who excites a quarrel originates it; to promote a
quarrel is strictly to foment and urge it on, the one who promotes keeping himself in the background.
Compare ABET; QUICKEN.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for ABASE; ALLAY.
* * * * *
PROPITIATION.
Synonyms:
atonement, expiation, reconciliation, satisfaction.
Atonement (at-one-ment), originally denoting reconciliation, or the bringing into agreement of those who have
been estranged, is now chiefly used, as in theology, in the sense of some offering, sacrifice, or suffering
sufficient to win forgiveness or make up for an offense; especially and distinctively of the sacrificial work of
Christ in his humiliation, suffering and death. Expiation is the enduring of the full penalty of a wrong or
crime. Propitiation is an offering, action, or sacrifice that makes the governing power propitious toward the
offender. Satisfaction in this connection denotes the rendering a full legal equivalent for the wrong done.
Propitiation appeases the lawgiver; satisfaction meets the requirements of the law.
Antonyms:
alienation, curse, penalty, reprobation, vengeance, chastisement, estrangement, punishment, retribution, wrath.
condemnation, offense,
* * * * *
PROPITIOUS.
Synonyms:
auspicious, benignant, favorable, gracious, kindly, benign, clement, friendly, kind, merciful.
That which is auspicious is of favorable omen; that which is propitious is of favoring influence or tendency;
as, an auspicious morning; a propitious breeze. Propitious applies to persons, implying kind disposition and
favorable inclinations, especially toward the suppliant; auspicious is not used of persons.
Antonyms:
adverse, forbidding, ill-disposed, repellent, unfriendly, antagonistic, hostile, inauspicious, unfavorable,
unpropitious.
Preposition:
May heaven be propitious to the enterprise.
* * * * *
PROPOSAL.
Synonyms:
bid, offer, overture, proposition.
An offer or proposal puts something before one for acceptance or rejection, proposal being the more formal
word; a proposition sets forth truth (or what is claimed to be truth) in formal statement. The proposition is for
consideration, the proposal for action; as, a proposition in geometry, a proposal of marriage; but proposition
is often used nearly in the sense of proposal when it concerns a matter for deliberation; as, a proposition for
the surrender of a fort. A bid is commercial and often verbal; as, a bid at an auction; proposal is used in nearly
the same sense, but is more formal. An overture opens negotiation or conference, and the word is especially
used of some movement toward reconciliation; as, overtures of peace.
Antonyms:
acceptance, denial, disapproval, refusal, rejection, repulse.
* * * * *
PROPOSE.
Synonym:
purpose.
In its most frequent use, propose differs from purpose in that what we purpose lies in our own mind, as a
decisive act of will, a determination; what we propose is offered or stated to others. In this use of the word,
what we propose is open to deliberation, as what we purpose is not. In another use of the word, one proposes
something to or by himself which may or may not be stated to others. In this latter sense propose is nearly
identical with purpose, and the two words have often been used interchangeably. But in the majority of cases
what we purpose is more general, what we propose more formal and definite; I purpose to do right; I propose
to do this specific thing because it is right. In the historic sentence, "I propose to move immediately on your
works," purpose would not have the same sharp directness.
* * * * *
PROTRACT.
Synonyms:
continue, delay, elongate, lengthen, procrastinate, defer, draw out, extend, postpone, prolong.
To protract is to cause to occupy a longer time than is usual, expected, or desirable. We defer a negotiation
which we are slow to enter upon; we protract a negotiation which we are slow to conclude; delay may be used
of any stage in the proceedings; we may delay a person as well as an action, but defer and protract are not
used of persons. Elongate is not used of actions or abstractions, but only of material objects or extension in
space; protract is very rarely used of concrete objects or extension in space; we elongate a line, protract a
discussion. Protract has usually an unfavorable sense, implying that the matter referred to is already unduly
long, or would be so if longer continued; continue is neutral, applying equally to the desirable or the
undesirable. Postpone implies a definite intention to resume, as defer also does, though less decidedly; both
are often used with some definite limitation of time; as, to postpone till, until, or to a certain day or hour. One
may defer, delay, or postpone a matter intelligently and for good reason; he procrastinates through indolence
and irresolution. Compare HINDER.
Antonyms:
abbreviate, conclude, curtail, hurry, reduce, abridge, contract, hasten, limit, shorten.
Prepositions:
To protract a speech by verbosity, through an unreasonable time, to, till, or until a late hour.
* * * * *
PROVERB.
Synonyms:
adage, axiom, maxim, saw, aphorism, byword, motto, saying, apothegm, dictum, precept, truism.
The proverb or adage gives homely truth in condensed, practical form, the adage often pictorial. "Hope
deferred maketh the heart sick" is a proverb; "The cat loves fish, but dares not wet her feet," is an adage. Both
the proverb and the adage, but especially the latter, are thought of as ancient and widely known. An aphorism
partakes of the character of a definition; it is a summary statement of what the author sees and believes to be
true. An apothegm is a terse statement of what is plain or easily proved. The aphorism is philosophical, the
apothegm practical. A dictum is a statement of some person or school, on whom it depends for authority; as, a
dictum of Aristotle. A saying is impersonal, current among the common people, deriving its authority from its
manifest truth or good sense; as, it is an old saying, "the more haste, the worse speed." A saw is a saying that
is old, but somewhat worn and tiresome. Precept is a command to duty; motto or maxim is a brief statement of
cherished truth, the maxim being more uniformly and directly practical; "God is love" may be a motto, "Fear
God and fear naught," a maxim. The precepts of the Sermon on the Mount will furnish the Christian with
invaluable maxims or mottoes. A byword is a phrase or saying used reproachfully or contemptuously.
* * * * *
PROWESS.
Synonyms:
bravery, gallantry, intrepidity, courage, heroism, valor.
Bravery, courage, heroism, and intrepidity may be silent, spiritual, or passive; they may be exhibited by a
martyr at the stake. Prowess and valor imply both daring and doing; we do not speak of the prowess of a
martyr, a child, or a passive sufferer. Valor meets odds or perils with courageous action, doing its utmost to
conquer at any risk or cost; prowess has power adapted to the need; dauntless valor is often vain against
superior prowess. Courage is a nobler word than bravery, involving more of the deep, spiritual, and enduring
elements of character; such an appreciation of peril as would extinguish bravery may only intensify courage,
which is resistant and self-conquering; courage applies to matters in regard to which valor and prowess can
have no place, as submission to a surgical operation, or the facing of censure or detraction for conscience'
sake. Compare BRAVE; FORTITUDE.
Antonyms:
cowardice, cowardliness, effeminacy, fear, pusillanimity, timidity.
* * * * *
PRUDENCE.
Synonyms:
care, discretion, judgment, carefulness, forecast, judiciousness, caution, foresight, providence, circumspection,
forethought, wisdom. consideration, frugality,
Prudence may be briefly defined as good judgment and foresight, inclining to caution and frugality in
practical affairs. Care may respect only the present; prudence and providence look far ahead and sacrifice the
present to the future, prudence watching, saving, guarding, providence planning, doing, preparing, and
perhaps expending largely to meet the future demand. Frugality is in many cases one form of prudence. In a
besieged city prudence will reduce the rations, providence will strain every nerve to introduce supplies and to
raise the siege. Foresight merely sees the future, and may even lead to the recklessness and desperation to
which prudence and providence are so strongly opposed. Forethought is thinking in accordance with wise
views of the future, and is nearly equivalent to providence, but it is a more popular and less comprehensive
term; we speak of man's forethought, God's providence. Compare CARE; FRUGALITY; WISDOM.
Antonyms:
folly, imprudence, rashness, thoughtlessness, heedlessness, indiscretion, recklessness, wastefulness.
improvidence, prodigality,

PURCHASE.
Synonyms:
acquire, barter for, get, procure, secure. bargain for, buy, obtain,
Buy and purchase are close synonyms, signifying to obtain or secure as one's own by paying or promising to
pay a price; in numerous cases the two words are freely interchangeable, but with the difference usually found
between words of Saxon and those of French or Latin origin. The Saxon buy is used for all the homely and
petty concerns of common life, the French purchase is often restricted to transactions of more dignity; yet the
Saxon word buy is commonly more emphatic, and in the higher ranges of thought appeals more strongly to the
feelings. One may either buy or purchase fame, favor, honor, pleasure, etc., but when our feelings are stirred
we speak of victory or freedom as dearly bought. "Buy the truth, and sell it not" (Prov. xxiii, 23) would be
greatly weakened by the rendering "Purchase the truth, and do not dispose of it." Compare BUSINESS; GET;
PRICE; SALE.
Antonyms:
barter, dispose of, exchange, put to sale, sell.
Prepositions:
Purchase at a price; at a public sale; of or from a person; for cash; with money; on time.

PURE.
Synonyms:
absolute, guiltless, simple, unmixed, chaste, holy, spotless, unpolluted, classic, immaculate, stainless,
unspotted, classical, incorrupt, true, unstained, clean, innocent, unadulterated, unsullied, clear, mere,
unblemished, untainted, continent, perfect, uncorrupted, untarnished, genuine, real, undefiled, upright,
guileless, sheer, unmingled, virtuous.
That is pure which is free from mixture or contact with anything that weakens, impairs, or pollutes. Material
substances are called pure in the strict sense when free from foreign admixture of any kind; as, pure oxygen;
the word is often used to signify free from any defiling or objectionable admixture (the original sense); we
speak of water as pure when it is bright, clear, and refreshing, tho it may contain mineral salts in solution; in
the medical and chemical sense, only distilled water (aqua pura) is pure. In moral and religious use pure is a
strong word, denoting positive excellence of a high order; one is innocent who knows nothing of evil, and has
experienced no touch of temptation; one is pure who, with knowledge of evil and exposure to temptation,
keeps heart and soul unstained. Virtuous refers primarily to right action; pure to right feeling and motives; as,
"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God," Matt. v, 8. Compare FINE; INNOCENT.
Antonyms:
adulterated, foul, indecent, obscene, tainted, defiled, gross, indelicate, polluted, tarnished, dirty, immodest,
lewd, stained, unchaste, filthy, impure, mixed, sullied, unclean.
* * * * *
PUT.
Synonyms:
deposit, lay, place, set.
Put is the most general term for bringing an object to some point or within some space, however exactly or
loosely; we may put a horse in a pasture, or put a bullet in a rifle or into an enemy. Place denotes more careful
movement and more exact location; as, to place a crown on one's head, or a garrison in a city. To lay is to
place in a horizontal position; to set is to place in an upright position; we lay a cloth, and set a dish upon a
table. To deposit is to put in a place of security for future use; as, to deposit money in a bank; the original
sense, to lay down or let down (quietly), is also common; as, the stream deposits sediment.
* * * * *
QUEER.
Synonyms:
anomalous, erratic, odd, strange, bizarre, extraordinary, peculiar, uncommon, comical, fantastic, preposterous,
unique, crotchety, funny, quaint, unmatched, curious, grotesque, ridiculous, unusual, droll, laughable,
singular, whimsical. eccentric, ludicrous,
Odd is unmated, as an odd shoe, and so uneven, as an odd number. Singular is alone of its kind; as, the
singular number. What is singular is odd, but what is odd may not be singular; as, a drawerful of odd gloves.
A strange thing is something hitherto unknown in fact or in cause. A singular coincidence is one the
happening of which is unusual; a strange coincidence is one the cause of which is hard to explain. That which
is peculiar belongs especially to a person as his own; as, Israel was called Jehovah's "peculiar people," i. e.,
especially chosen and cherished by him; in its ordinary use there is the implication that the thing peculiar to
one is not common to the majority nor quite approved by them, though it may be shared by many; as, the
Shakers are peculiar. Eccentric is off or aside from the center, and so off or aside from the ordinary and what
is considered the normal course; as, genius is commonly eccentric. Eccentric is a higher and more respectful
word than odd or queer. Erratic signifies wandering, a stronger and more censorious term than eccentric.
Queer is transverse or oblique, aside from the common in a way that is comical or perhaps slightly ridiculous.
Quaint denotes that which is pleasingly odd and fanciful, often with something of the antique; as, the quaint
architecture of medieval towns. That which is funny is calculated to provoke laughter; that which is droll is
more quietly amusing. That which is grotesque in the material sense is irregular or misshapen in form or
outline or ill-proportioned so as to be somewhat ridiculous; the French bizarre is practically equivalent to
grotesque.
Antonyms:
common, familiar, normal, regular, customary, natural, ordinary, usual.

QUICKEN.
Synonyms:
accelerate, drive on, hasten, promote, advance, expedite, hurry, speed, despatch, facilitate, make haste, urge,
drive, further, press forward, urge on.
To quicken, in the sense here considered, is to increase speed, move or cause to move more rapidly, as
through more space or with, a greater number of motions in the same time. To accelerate is to increase the
speed of action or of motion. A motion whose speed increases upon itself is said to be accelerated, as the
motion of a falling body, which becomes swifter with every second of time. To accelerate any work is to
hasten it toward a finish, commonly by quickening all its operations in orderly unity toward the result. To
despatch is to do and be done with, to get a thing off one's hands. To despatch an enemy is to kill him outright
and quickly; to despatch a messenger is to send him in haste; to despatch a business is to bring it quickly to an
end. Despatch is commonly used of single items. To promote a cause is in any way to bring it forward,
advance it in power, prominence, etc. To speed is really to secure swiftness; to hasten is to attempt it, whether
successfully or unsuccessfully. Hurry always indicates something of confusion. The hurried man forgets
dignity, appearance, comfort, courtesy, everything but speed; he may forget something vital to the matter in
hand; yet, because reckless haste may attain the great object of speed, hurry has come to be the colloquial and
popular word for acting quickly. To facilitate is to quicken by making easy; to expedite is to quicken by
removing hindrances. A good general will improve roads to facilitate the movements of troops, hasten
supplies and perfect discipline to promote the general efficiency of the force, despatch details of business,
expedite all preparations, in order to accelerate the advance and victory of his army.
Antonyms:
check, clog, delay, drag, hinder, impede, obstruct, retard.
* * * * *
QUOTE.
Synonyms:
cite, extract, plagiarize, repeat. excerpt, paraphrase, recite,
To quote is to give an author's words, either exactly, as in direct quotation, or in substance, as in indirect
quotation; to cite is, etymologically, to call up a passage, as a witness is summoned. In citing a passage its
exact location by chapter, page, or otherwise, must be given, so that it can be promptly called into evidence; in
quoting, the location may or may not be given, but the words or substance of the passage must be given. In
citing, neither the author's words nor his thought may be given, but simply the reference to the location where
they may be found. To quote, in the proper sense, is to give credit to the author whose words are employed.
To paraphrase is to state an author's thought more freely than in indirect quotation, keeping the substance of
thought and the order of statement, but changing the language, and commonly interweaving more or less
explanatory matter as if part of the original writing. One may paraphrase a work with worthy motive for
homiletic, devotional, or other purposes (as in the metrical versions of the Psalms), or he may plagiarize
atrociously in the form of paraphrase, appropriating all that is valuable in another's thought, with the hope of
escaping detection by change of phrase. To plagiarize is to quote without credit, appropriating another's words
or thought as one's own. To recite or repeat is usually to quote orally, tho recite is applied in legal phrase to a
particular statement of facts which is not a quotation; a kindred use obtains in ordinary speech; as, to recite
one's misfortunes.
* * * * *
RACY.
Synonyms:
flavorous, lively, pungent, spicy, forcible, piquant, rich, spirited.
Racy applies in the first instance to the pleasing flavor characteristic of certain wines, often attributed to the
soil from which they come. Pungent denotes something sharply irritating to the organs of taste or smell, as
pepper, vinegar, ammonia; piquant denotes a quality similar in kind to pungent but less in degree, stimulating
and agreeable; pungent spices may be deftly compounded into a piquant sauce. As applied to literary
products, racy refers to that which has a striking, vigorous, pleasing originality; spicy to that which is
stimulating to the mental taste, as spice is to the physical; piquant and pungent in their figurative use keep
very close to their literal sense.
Antonyms:
cold, flat, insipid, stale, tasteless, dull, flavorless, prosy, stupid, vapid.
* * * * *
RADICAL.
Synonyms:
complete, ingrained, perfect, constitutional, innate, positive, entire, native, primitive, essential, natural,
thorough, extreme, organic, thoroughgoing, fundamental, original, total.
The widely divergent senses in which the word radical is used, by which it can be at some time interchanged
with any word in the above list, are all formed upon the one primary sense of having to do with or proceeding
from the root (L. radix); a radical difference is one that springs from the root, and is thus constitutional,
essential, fundamental, organic, original; a radical change is one that does not stop at the surface, but reaches
down to the very root, and is entire, thorough, total; since the majority find superficial treatment of any matter
the easiest and most comfortable, radical measures, which strike at the root of evil or need, are apt to be
looked upon as extreme.
Antonyms:
conservative, incomplete, palliative, slight, tentative, inadequate, moderate, partial, superficial, trial.
* * * * *
RARE.
Synonyms:
curious, odd, scarce, unique, extraordinary, peculiar, singular, unparalleled, incomparable, precious, strange,
unprecedented, infrequent, remarkable, uncommon, unusual.
Unique is alone of its kind; rare is infrequent of its kind; great poems are rare; "Paradise Lost" is unique. To
say of a thing that it is rare is simply to affirm that it is now seldom found, whether previously common or
not; as, a rare old book; a rare word; to call a thing scarce implies that it was at some time more plenty, as
when we say food or money is scarce. A particular fruit or coin may be rare; scarce applies to demand and
use, and almost always to concrete things; to speak of virtue, genius, or heroism as scarce would be somewhat
ludicrous. Rare has the added sense of precious, which is sometimes, but not necessarily, blended with that
above given; as, a rare gem. Extraordinary, signifying greatly beyond the ordinary, is a neutral word, capable
of a high and good sense or of an invidious, opprobrious, or contemptuous signification; as, extraordinary
genius; extraordinary wickedness; an extraordinary assumption of power; extraordinary antics; an
extraordinary statement is incredible without overwhelming proof.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for GENERAL; NORMAL; USUAL.
* * * * *
REACH.
Synonyms:
arrive, attain, come to, enter, gain, get to, land.
To reach, in the sense here considered, is to come to by motion or progress. Attain is now oftenest used of
abstract relations; as, to attain success. When applied to concrete matters, it commonly signifies the
overcoming of hindrance and difficulty; as, the storm-beaten ship at length attained the harbor. Come is the
general word for moving to or toward the place where the speaker or writer is or supposes himself to be. To
reach is to come to from a distance that is actually or relatively considerable; to stretch the journey, so to
speak, across the distance, as, in its original meaning, one reaches an object by stretching out the hand. To
gain is to reach or attain something eagerly sought; the wearied swimmer reaches or gains the shore. One
comes in from his garden; he reaches home from a journey. To arrive is to come to a destination, to reach a
point intended or proposed. The European steamer arrives in port, or reaches the harbor; the dismantled
wreck drifts ashore, or comes to land. Compare ATTAIN.
Antonyms:
depart, go, go away, leave, set out, set sail, start, weigh anchor. embark,
* * * * *
REAL.
Synonyms:
actual, demonstrable, genuine, true, authentic, developed, positive, unquestionable, certain, essential,
substantial, veritable.
Real (L. res, a thing) signifies having existence, not merely in thought, but in fact, or being in fact according
to appearance or claim; denoting the thing as distinguished from the name, or the existent as opposed to the
non-existent. Actual has respect to a thing accomplished by doing, real to a thing as existing by whatever
means or from whatever cause, positive to that which is fixed or established, developed to that which has
reached completion by a natural process of unfolding. Actual is in opposition to the supposed, conceived, or
reported, and furnishes the proof of its existence in itself; real is opposed to feigned or imaginary, and is
capable of demonstration; positive, to the uncertain or doubtful; developed, to that which is undeveloped or
incomplete. The developed is susceptible of proof; the positive precludes the necessity for proof. The present
condition of a thing is its actual condition; ills are real that have a substantial reason; proofs are positive when
they give the mind certainty; a plant is developed when it has reached its completed stage. Real estate is land,
together with trees, water, minerals, or other natural accompaniments, and any permanent structures that man
has built upon it. Compare AUTHENTIC.
Antonyms:
conceived, feigned, illusory, supposed, unreal, fabulous, fictitious, imaginary, supposititious, untrue, fanciful,
hypothetical, reported, theoretical, visionary.

REASON, v.
Synonyms:
argue, debate, discuss, establish, question, contend, demonstrate, dispute, prove, wrangle. controvert,
To reason is to examine by means of the reason, to prove by reasoning, or to influence or seek to influence
others by reasoning or reasons. Persons may contend either from mere ill will or self-interest, or from the
highest motives; "That ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints," Jude
3. To argue (L. arguo, show) is to make a matter clear by reasoning; to discuss (L. dis, apart, and quatio,
shake) is, etymologically, to shake it apart for examination and analysis. Demonstrate strictly applies to
mathematical or exact reasoning; prove may be used in the same sense, but is often applied to reasoning upon
matters of fact by what is called probable evidence, which can give only moral and not absolute or
mathematical certainty. To demonstrate is to force the mind to a conclusion by irresistible reasoning; to prove
is rather to establish a fact by evidence; as, to prove one innocent or guilty. That which has been either
demonstrated or proved so as to secure general acceptance is said to be established. Reason is a neutral word,
not, like argue, debate, discuss, etc., naturally or necessarily implying contest. We reason about a matter by
bringing up all that reason can give us on any side. A dispute may be personal, fractious, and petty; a debate is
formal and orderly; if otherwise, it becomes a mere wrangle.
Prepositions:
We reason with a person about a subject, for or against an opinion; we reason a person into or out of a course
of action; or we may reason down an opponent or opposition; one reasons from a cause to an effect.
* * * * *
REASON, n.
Synonyms:
account, cause, end, motive, principle, aim, consideration, ground, object, purpose. argument, design,
While the cause of any event, act, or fact, as commonly understood, is the power that makes it to be, the
reason of or for it is the explanation given by the human mind; but reason is, in popular language, often used
as equivalent to cause, especially in the sense of final cause. In the statement of any reasoning, the argument
may be an entire syllogism, or the premises considered together apart from the conclusion, or in logical
strictness the middle term only by which the particular conclusion is connected with the general statement.
But when the reasoning is not in strict logical form, the middle term following the conclusion is called the
reason; thus in the statement "All tyrants deserve death; Csar was a tyrant; Therefore Csar deserved
death," "Csar was a tyrant" would in the strictest sense be called the argument; but if we say "Csar
deserved death because he was a tyrant," the latter clause would be termed the reason. Compare CAUSE;
REASON, v.; MIND; REASONING.
Prepositions:
The reason of a thing that is to be explained; the reason for a thing that is to be done.
* * * * *
REASONING.
Synonyms:
argument, argumentation, debate, ratiocination.
Argumentation and debate, in the ordinary use of the words, suppose two parties alleging reasons for and
against a proposition; the same idea appears figuratively when we speak of a debate or an argument with
oneself, or of a debate between reason and conscience. Reasoning may be the act of one alone, as it is simply
the orderly setting forth of reasons, whether for the instruction of inquirers, the confuting of opponents, or the
clear establishment of truth for oneself. Reasoning may be either deductive or inductive. Argument or
argumentation was formerly used of deductive reasoning only. With the rise of the inductive philosophy these
words have come to be applied to inductive processes also; but while reasoning may be informal or even (as
far as tracing its processes is concerned) unconscious, argument and argumentation strictly imply logical
form. Reasoning, as denoting a process, is a broader term than reason or argument; many arguments or
reasons may be included in a single chain of reasoning.
* * * * *
REBELLIOUS.
Synonyms:
contumacious, mutinous, uncontrollable, disobedient, refractory, ungovernable, insubordinate, seditious,
unmanageable. intractable,
Rebellious signifies being in a state of rebellion (see REBELLION under REVOLUTION), and is even
extended to inanimate things that resist control or adaptation to human use. Ungovernable applies to that
which successfully defies authority and power; unmanageable to that which resists the utmost exercise of skill
or of skill and power combined; rebellious, to that which is defiant of authority, whether successfully or
unsuccessfully; seditious, to that which partakes of or tends to excite a rebellious spirit, seditious suggesting
more of covert plan, scheming, or conspiracy, rebellious more of overt act or open violence. While the
unmanageable or ungovernable defies control, the rebellious or seditious may be forced to submission; as, the
man has an ungovernable temper; the horses became unmanageable; he tamed his rebellious spirit.
Insubordinate applies to the disposition to resist and resent control as such; mutinous, to open defiance of
authority, especially in the army, navy, or merchant marine. A contumacious act or spirit is contemptuous as
well as defiant. Compare OBSTINATE; REVOLUTION.
Antonyms:
compliant, docile, manageable, subservient, controllable, dutiful, obedient, tractable, deferential, gentle,
submissive, yielding.
Prepositions:
Rebellious to or against lawful authority.
* * * * *
RECORD.
Synonyms:
account, enrolment, instrument, register, archive, entry, inventory, roll, catalogue, enumeration,
memorandum, schedule, chronicle, history, memorial, scroll. document, inscription, muniment,
A memorial is any object, whether a writing, a monument, or other permanent thing that is designed or
adapted to keep something in remembrance. Record is a word of wide signification, applying to any writing,
mark, or trace that serves as a memorial giving enduring attestation of an event or fact; an extended account,
chronicle, or history is a record; so, too, may be a brief inventory or memorandum; the inscription on a
tombstone is a record of the dead; the stri on a rock-surface are the record of a glacier's passage. A register
is a formal or official written record, especially a series of entries made for preservation or reference; as, a
register of births and deaths. Archives, in the sense here considered, are documents or records, often legal
records, preserved in a public or official depository; the word archives is also applied to the place where such
documents are regularly deposited and preserved. Muniments (L. munio, fortify) are records that enable one to
defend his title. Compare HISTORY; STORY.
* * * * *
RECOVER.
Synonyms:
be cured or healed, heal, recuperate, restore, be restored, reanimate, regain, resume, cure, recruit, repossess,
retrieve.
The transitive use of recover in the sense of cure, heal, etc., as in 2 Kings v, 6, "That thou mayest recover him
of his leprosy," is now practically obsolete. The chief transitive use of recover is in the sense to obtain again
after losing, regain, repossess, etc.; as, to recover stolen goods; to recover health. The intransitive sense, be
cured, be restored, etc., is very common; as, to recover from sickness, terror, or misfortune.
Antonyms:
die, fail, grow worse, relapse, sink.
Prepositions:
From; rarely of; (Law) to recover judgment against, to recover damages of or from a person.
* * * * *
REFINEMENT.
Synonyms:
civilization, cultivation, culture, elegance, politeness.
Civilization applies to nations, denoting the sum of those civil, social, economic, and political attainments by
which a community is removed from barbarism; a people may be civilized while still far from refinement or
culture, but civilization is susceptible of various degrees and of continued progress. Refinement applies either
to nations or individuals, denoting the removal of what is coarse and rude, and a corresponding attainment of
what is delicate, elegant, and beautiful. Cultivation, denoting primarily the process of cultivating the soil or
growing crops, then the improved condition of either which is the result, is applied in similar sense to the
human mind and character, but in this usage is now largely superseded by the term culture, which denotes a
high development of the best qualities of man's mental and spiritual nature, with especial reference to the
esthetic faculties and to graces of speech and manner, regarded as the expression of a refined nature. Culture
in the fullest sense denotes that degree of refinement and development which results from continued
cultivation through successive generations; a man's faculties may be brought to a high degree of cultivation in
some specialty, while he himself remains uncultured even to the extent of coarseness and rudeness. Compare
HUMANE; POLITE.
Antonyms:
barbarism, brutality, coarseness, rudeness, savagery, boorishness, clownishness, grossness, rusticity, vulgarity.
* * * * *
REFUTE.
Synonyms:
confound, confute, disprove, overthrow, repel.
To refute and to confute are to answer so as to admit of no reply. To refute a statement is to demonstrate its
falsity by argument or countervailing proof; confute is substantially the same in meaning, tho differing in
usage. Refute applies either to arguments and opinions or to accusations; confute is not applied to accusations
and charges, but to arguments or opinions. Refute is not now applied to persons, but confute is in good use in
this application; a person is confuted when his arguments are refuted.
* * * * *
RELIABLE.
Synonyms:
trustworthy, trusty.
The word reliable has been sharply challenged, but seems to have established its place in the language. The
objection to its use on the ground that the suffix -able can not properly be added to an intransitive verb is
answered by the citation of such words as "available," "conversable," "laughable," and the like, while, in the
matter of usage, reliable has the authority of Coleridge, Martineau, Mill, Irving, Newman, Gladstone, and
others of the foremost of recent English writers. The objection to the application of reliable to persons is not
sustained by the use of the verb "rely," which is applied to persons in the authorized version of the Scriptures,
in the writings of Shakespeare and Bacon, and in the usage of good speakers and writers. Trusty and
trustworthy refer to inherent qualities of a high order, trustworthy being especially applied to persons, and
denoting moral integrity and truthfulness; we speak of a trusty sword, a trusty servant; we say the man is
thoroughly trustworthy. Reliable is inferior in meaning, denoting merely the possession of such qualities as
are needed for safe reliance; as, a reliable pledge; reliable information. A man is said to be reliable with
reference not only to moral qualities, but to judgment, knowledge, skill, habit, or perhaps pecuniary ability; a
thoroughly trustworthy person might not be reliable as a witness on account of unconscious sympathy, or as a
security by reason of insufficient means. A reliable messenger is one who may be depended on to do his
errand correctly and promptly; a trusty or trustworthy messenger is one who may be admitted to knowledge of
the views and purposes of those who employ him, and who will be faithful beyond the mere letter of his
commission. We can speak of a railroad-train as reliable when it can be depended on to arrive on time; but to
speak of a reliable friend would be cold, and to speak of a warrior girding on his reliable sword would be
ludicrous.
* * * * *
RELIGION.
Synonyms:
devotion, godliness, morality, piety, theology, faith, holiness, pietism, righteousness, worship.
Piety is primarily filial duty, as of children to parents, and hence, in its highest sense, a loving obedience and
service to God as the Heavenly Father; pietism often denotes a mystical, sometimes an affected piety; religion
is the reverent acknowledgment both in heart and in act of a divine being. Religion, in the fullest and highest
sense, includes all the other words of this group. Worship may be external and formal, or it may be the
adoring reverence of the human spirit for the divine, seeking outward expression. Devotion, which in its
fullest sense is self-consecration, is often used to denote an act of worship, especially prayer or adoration; as,
he is engaged in his devotions. Morality is the system and practise of duty as required by the moral law,
consisting chiefly in outward acts, and thus may be observed without spiritual rectitude of heart; morality is of
necessity included in all true religion, which involves both outward act and spiritual service. Godliness
(primarily godlikeness) is a character and spirit like that of God. Holiness is the highest, sinless perfection of
any spirit, whether divine or human, tho often used for purity or for consecration. Theology is the science of
religion, or the study and scientific statement of all that the human mind can know of God. Faith, strictly the
belief and trust which the soul exercises toward God, is often used as a comprehensive word for a whole
system of religion considered as the object of faith; as, the Christian faith; the Mohammedan faith.
Antonyms:
atheism, godlessness, irreligion, sacrilege, ungodliness, blasphemy, impiety, profanity, unbelief, wickedness.
* * * * *
RELUCTANT.
Synonyms:
averse, disinclined, loath, slow, backward, indisposed, opposed, unwilling.
Reluctant (L. re, back, and lucto, strive, struggle) signifies struggling against what one is urged or impelled to
do, or is actually doing; averse (L. a, from, and verto, turn) signifies turned away as with dislike or
repugnance; loath (AS. lath, evil, hateful) signifies having a repugnance, disgust, or loathing for, tho the
adjective loath is not so strong as the verb loathe. A dunce is always averse to study; a good student is
disinclined to it when a fine morning tempts him out; he is indisposed to it in some hour of weariness. A man
may be slow or backward in entering upon that to which he is by no means averse. A man is loath to believe
evil of his friend, reluctant to speak of it, absolutely unwilling to use it to his injury. A legislator may be
opposed to a certain measure, while not averse to what it aims to accomplish. Compare ANTIPATHY.
Antonyms:
desirous, disposed, eager, favorable, inclined, willing.
* * * * *
REMARK.
Synonyms:
annotation, comment, note, observation, utterance.
A remark is a saying or brief statement, oral or written, commonly made without much premeditation; a
comment is an explanatory or critical remark, as upon some passage in a literary work or some act or speech
in common life. A note is something to call attention, hence a brief written statement; in correspondence, a
note is briefer than a letter. A note upon some passage in a book is briefer and less elaborate than a comment.
Annotations are especially brief notes, commonly marginal, and closely following the text. Comments,
observations, or remarks may be oral or written, comments being oftenest written, and remarks oftenest oral.
An observation is properly the result of fixed attention and reflection; a remark may be the suggestion of the
instant. Remarks are more informal than a speech.
* * * * *
REND.
Synonyms:
break, cleave, mangle, rive, sever, sunder, burst, lacerate, rip, rupture, slit, tear.
Rend and tear are applied to the separating of textile substances into parts by force violently applied (rend
also to frangible substances), tear being the milder, rend the stronger word. Rive is a wood-workers' word for
parting wood in the way of the grain without a clean cut. To lacerate is to tear roughly the flesh or animal
tissue, as by the teeth of a wild beast; a lacerated wound is distinguished from a wound made by a clean cut or
incision. Mangle is a stronger word than lacerate; lacerate is more superficial, mangle more complete. To
burst or rupture is to tear or rend by force from within, burst denoting the greater violence; as, to burst a gun;
to rupture a blood-vessel; a steam-boiler may be ruptured when its substance is made to divide by internal
pressure without explosion. To rip, as usually applied to garments or other articles made by sewing or
stitching, is to divide along the line of a seam by cutting or breaking the stitches; the other senses bear some
resemblance or analogy to this; as, to rip open a wound. Compare BREAK.
Antonyms:
heal, mend, reunite, secure, sew, solder, stitch, unite, weld. join,
* * * * *
RENOUNCE.
Synonyms:
abandon, disavow, disown, recant, repudiate, abjure, discard, forswear, refuse, retract, deny, disclaim, recall,
reject, revoke.
Abjure, discard, forswear, recall, recant, renounce, retract, and revoke, like abandon, imply some previous
connection. Renounce (L. re, back, and nuntio, bear a message) is to declare against and give up formally and
definitively; as, to renounce the pomps and vanities of the world. Recant (L. re, back, and canto, sing) is to
take back or deny formally and publicly, as a belief that one has held or professed. Retract (L. re, back, and
traho, draw) is to take back something that one has said as not true or as what one is not ready to maintain; as,
to retract a charge or accusation; one recants what was especially his own, he retracts what was directed
against another. Repudiate (L. re, back, or away, and pudeo, feel shame) is primarily to renounce as shameful,
hence to divorce, as a wife; thus in general to put away with emphatic and determined repulsion; as, to
repudiate a debt. To deny is to affirm to be not true or not binding; as, to deny a statement or a relationship; or
to refuse to grant as something requested; as, his mother could not deny him what he desired. To discard is to
cast away as useless or worthless; thus, one discards a worn garment; a coquette discards a lover. Revoke (L.
re, back, and voco, call), etymologically the exact equivalent of the English recall, is to take back something
given or granted; as, to revoke a command, a will, or a grant; recall may be used in the exact sense of revoke,
but is often applied to persons, as revoke is not; we recall a messenger and revoke the order with which he
was charged. Abjure (L. ab, away, and juro, swear) is etymologically the exact equivalent of the Saxon
forswear, signifying to put away formally and under oath, as an error, heresy, or evil practise, or a condemned
and detested person. A man abjures his religion, recants his belief, abjures or renounces his allegiance,
repudiates another's claim, renounces his own, retracts a false statement. A person may deny, disavow,
disclaim, disown what has been truly or falsely imputed to him or supposed to be his. He may deny his
signature, disavow the act of his agent, disown his child; he may repudiate a just claim or a base suggestion. A
native of the United States can not abjure or renounce allegiance to the Queen of England, but will promptly
deny or repudiate it. Compare ABANDON.
Antonyms:
acknowledge, assert, cherish, defend, maintain, proclaim, uphold, advocate, avow, claim, hold, own, retain,
vindicate.

REPENTANCE.
Synonyms:
compunction, contriteness, regret, self-condemnation, contrition, penitence, remorse, sorrow.
Regret is sorrow for any painful or annoying matter. One is moved with penitence for wrong-doing. To speak
of regret for a fault of our own marks it as slighter than one regarding which we should express penitence.
Repentance is sorrow for sin with self-condemnation, and complete turning from the sin. Penitence is
transient, and may involve no change of character or conduct. There may be sorrow without repentance, as for
consequences only, but not repentance without sorrow. Compunction is a momentary sting of conscience, in
view either of a past or of a contemplated act. Contrition is a subduing sorrow for sin, as against the divine
holiness and love. Remorse is, as its derivation indicates, a biting or gnawing back of guilt upon the heart,
with no turning of heart from the sin, and no suggestion of divine forgiveness.
Antonyms:
approval, content, obduracy, self-complacency, comfort, hardness, obstinacy, self-congratulation,
complacency, impenitence, self-approval, stubbornness.
Prepositions:
Repentance of or in heart, or from the heart; repentance for sins; before or toward God; unto life.
* * * * *
REPORT.
Synonyms:
account, narrative, rehearsal, rumor, story, description, recital, relation, statement, tale. narration, record,
Account carries the idea of a commercial summary. A statement is definite, confined to essentials and properly
to matters within the personal knowledge of the one who states them; as, an ante-mortem statement. A
narrative is a somewhat extended and embellished account of events in order of time, ordinarily with a view
to please or entertain. A description gives especial scope to the pictorial element. A report (L. re, back, and
porto, bring), as its etymology implies, is something brought back, as by one sent to obtain information, and
may be concise and formal or highly descriptive and dramatic. Compare ALLEGORY; HISTORY; RECORD.
* * * * *
REPROOF.
Synonyms:
admonition, chiding, disapproval, reprimand, animadversion, comment, objurgation, reproach, blame,
condemnation, rebuke, reproval, censure, criticism, reflection, upbraiding. check, denunciation, reprehension,
Blame, censure, and disapproval may either be felt or uttered; comment, criticism, rebuke, reflection,
reprehension, and reproof are always expressed. The same is true of admonition and animadversion.
Comment and criticism may be favorable as well as censorious; they imply no superiority or authority on the
part of him who utters them; nor do reflection or reprehension, which are simply turning the mind back upon
what is disapproved. Reprehension is supposed to be calm and just, and with good intent; it is therefore a
serious matter, however mild, and is capable of great force, as expressed in the phrase severe reprehension.
Reflection is often from mere ill feeling, and is likely to be more personal and less impartial than
reprehension; we often speak of unkind or unjust reflections. Rebuke, literally a stopping of the mouth, is
administered to a forward or hasty person; reproof is administered to one intentionally or deliberately wrong;
both words imply authority in the reprover, and direct expression of disapproval to the face of the person
rebuked or reproved. Reprimand is official censure formally administered by a superior to one under his
command. Animadversion is censure of a high, authoritative, and somewhat formal kind. Rebuke may be
given at the outset, or in the midst of an action; animadversion, reflection, reprehension, reproof, always
follow the act; admonition is anticipatory, and meant to be preventive. Check is allied to rebuke, and given
before or during action; chiding is nearer to reproof, but with more of personal bitterness and less of authority.
Compare CONDEMN; REPROVE.
Antonyms:
applause, approval, encomium, eulogy, panegyric, praise. approbation, commendation,

REPROVE.
Synonyms:
admonish, condemn, reprimand, blame, expostulate with, reproach, censure, find fault with, take to task,
chasten, rebuke, upbraid, check, remonstrate with, warn. chide, reprehend,
To censure is to pronounce an adverse judgment that may or may not be expressed to the person censured; to
reprove is to censure authoritatively, openly, and directly to the face of the person reproved; to rebuke is to
reprove with sharpness, and often with abruptness, usually in the midst of some action or course of action
deemed censurable; to reprimand is to reprove officially; to blame is a familiar word signifying to pass
censure upon, make answerable, as for a fault; blame and censure apply either to persons or acts; reprove and
rebuke are applied chiefly, and reprimand exclusively to persons. To reproach is to censure openly and
vehemently, and with intense personal feeling as of grief or anger; as, to reproach one for ingratitude;
reproach knows no distinction of rank or character; a subject may reproach a king or a criminal judge. To
expostulate or remonstrate with is to mingle reasoning and appeal with censure in the hope of winning one
from his evil way, expostulate being the gentler, remonstrate the severer word. Admonish is the mildest of
reproving words, and may even be used of giving a caution or warning where no wrong is implied, or of
simply reminding of duty which might be forgotten. Censure, rebuke, and reprove apply to wrong that has
been done; warn and admonish refer to anticipated error or fault. When one is admonished because of wrong
already done, the view is still future, that he may not repeat or continue in the wrong. Compare CONDEMN;
REPROOF.
Antonyms:
abet, approve, countenance, impel, instigate, applaud, cheer, encourage, incite, urge on.

REQUITE.
Synonyms:
avenge, punish, remunerate, revenge, compensate, quit, repay, reward, pay, reciprocate, retaliate, satisfy, pay
off, recompense, return, settle with.
To repay or to retaliate, to punish or to reward, may be to make some return very inadequate to the benefit or
injury received, or the right or wrong done; but to requite (according to its etymology) is to make so full and
adequate a return as to quit oneself of all obligation of favor or hostility, of punishment or reward. Requite is
often used in the more general sense of recompense or repay, but always with the suggestion, at least, of the
original idea of full equivalent; when one speaks of requiting kindness with ingratitude, the expression gains
force from the comparison of the actual with the proper and appropriate return. Compare PAY.
Antonyms:
absolve, excuse, forgive, overlook, pass over, acquit, forget, neglect, pardon, slight.
Preposition:
To requite injury with injury is human, but not Christian.
* * * * *
REST.
Synonyms:
calm, pause, quietness, slumber, calmness, peace, quietude, stay, cessation, peacefulness, recreation, stillness,
ease, quiescence, repose, stop, intermission, quiet, sleep, tranquillity.
Ease denotes freedom from cause of disturbance, whether external or internal. Quiet denotes freedom from
agitation, or especially from annoying sounds. Rest is a cessation of activity especially of wearying or painful
activity. Recreation is some pleasing activity of certain organs or faculties that affords rest to other parts of
our nature that have become weary. Repose is a laying down, primarily of the body, and figuratively a similar
freedom from toil or strain of mind. Repose is more complete than rest; a pause is a momentary cessation of
activity; a black-smith finds a temporary rest while the iron is heating, but he does not yield to repose; in a
pause of battle a soldier rests on his arms; after the battle the victor reposes on his laurels. Sleep is the
perfection of repose, the most complete rest; slumber is a light and ordinarily pleasant form of sleep. In the
figurative sense, rest of mind, soul, conscience, is not mere cessation of activity, but a pleasing, tranquil relief
from all painful and wearying activity; repose is even more deep, tranquil, and complete.
Antonyms:
agitation, disturbance, movement, stir, tumult, commotion, excitement, restlessness, strain, unrest, disquiet,
motion, rush, toil, work.
* * * * *
RESTIVE.
Synonyms:
balky, impatient, rebellious, restless, fidgety, intractable, recalcitrant, skittish, fractious, mulish, refractory,
stubborn, fretful, mutinous, resentful, unruly, frisky, obstinate, restiff, vicious.
Balky, mulish, obstinate, and stubborn are synonyms of restive only in an infrequent if not obsolete use; the
supposed sense of "tending to rest," "standing stubbornly still," is scarcely supported by any examples, and
those cited to support that meaning often fail to do so. The disposition to offer active resistance to control by
any means whatever is what is commonly indicated by restive in the best English speech and literature.
Dryden speaks of "the pampered colt" as "restiff to the rein;" but the rein is not used to propel a horse forward,
but to hold him in, and it is against this that he is "restiff." A horse may be made restless by flies or by martial
music, but with no refractoriness; the restive animal impatiently resists or struggles to break from control, as
by bolting, flinging his rider, or otherwise. With this the metaphorical use of the word agrees, which is always
in the sense of such terms as impatient, intractable, rebellious, and the like; a people restive under despotism
are not disposed to "rest" under it, but to resist it and fling it off.
Antonyms:
docile, manageable, passive, quiet, tractable, gentle, obedient, peaceable, submissive, yielding.
* * * * *
RESTRAIN.
Synonyms:
abridge, constrain, hold in, keep under, bridle, curb, keep, repress, check, hinder, keep back, restrict,
circumscribe, hold, keep down, suppress, confine, hold back, keep in, withhold.
To restrain is to hold back from acting, proceeding, or advancing, either by physical or moral force. Constrain
is positive; restrain is negative; one is constrained to an action; he is restrained from an action. Constrain
refers almost exclusively to moral force, restrain frequently to physical force, as when we speak of putting
one under restraint. To restrain an action is to hold it partially or wholly in check, so that it is under pressure
even while it acts; to restrict an action is to fix a limit or boundary which it may not pass, but within which it
is free. To repress, literally to press back, is to hold in check, and perhaps only temporarily, that which is still
very active; it is a feebler word than restrain; to suppress is finally and effectually to put down; suppress is a
much stronger word than restrain; as, to suppress a rebellion. Compare ARREST; BIND; KEEP.
Antonyms:
aid, arouse, encourage, free, incite, release, animate, emancipate, excite, impel, let loose, set free.
* * * * *
RETIREMENT.
Synonyms:
loneliness, privacy, seclusion, solitude.
In retirement one withdraws from association he has had with others; we speak of the retirement of a public
man to private life, tho he may still be much in company. In seclusion one shuts himself away from the
society of all except intimate friends or attendants; in solitude no other person is present. While seclusion is
ordinarily voluntary, solitude may be enforced; we speak of the solitude rather than the seclusion of a
prisoner. As "private" denotes what concerns ourselves individually, privacy denotes freedom from the
presence or observation of those not concerned or whom we desire not to have concerned in our affairs;
privacy is more commonly temporary than seclusion; we speak of a moment's privacy. There may be
loneliness without solitude, as amid an unsympathizing crowd, and solitude without loneliness, as when one is
glad to be alone.
Antonyms:
association, companionship, company, converse, fellowship, society.
* * * * *
REVELATION.
Synonyms:
apocalypse, disclosure, manifestation.
Revelation (L. re, back, and velum, veil), literally an unveiling, is the act or process of making known what
was before secret or hidden, or what may still be future. Apocalypse (Gr. apo, from, and kalypto, cover),
literally an uncovering, comes into English as the name of the closing book of the Bible. The Apocalypse
unveils the future, as if to the very gaze of the seer; the whole gospel is a disclosure of the mercy of God; the
character of Christ is a manifestation of the divine holiness and love; all Scripture is a revelation of the divine
will. Or we might say that nature is a manifestation of the divine character and will, of which Scripture is the
fuller and more express revelation.
Antonyms:
cloud, concealment, mystery, shrouding, cloudiness, hiding, obscuration, veiling.
* * * * *
REVENGE.
Synonyms:
avenging, retaliation, retribution, vengeance. requital,
Revenge is the act of making return for an injury done to oneself by doing injury to another person.
Retaliation and revenge are personal and often bitter. Retaliation may be partial; revenge is meant to be
complete, and may be excessive. Vengeance, which once meant an indignant vindication of justice, now
signifies the most furious and unsparing revenge. Revenge emphasizes more the personal injury in return for
which it is inflicted, vengeance the ill desert of those upon whom it is inflicted. A requital is strictly an even
return, such as to quit one of obligation for what has been received, and even if poor or unworthy is given as
complete and adequate. Avenging and retribution give a solemn sense of exact justice, avenging being more
personal in its infliction, whether by God or man, and retribution the impersonal visitation of the doom of
righteous law. Compare AVENGE; HATRED; REQUITE.
Antonyms:
compassion, forgiveness, mercy, pardon, pity, reconciliation. excuse, grace,
Prepositions:
To take revenge upon the enemy, for the injury.
* * * * *
REVOLUTION.
Synonyms:
anarchy, insurrection, revolt, confusion, lawlessness, riot, disintegration, mutiny, sedition, disorder, rebellion,
tumult. insubordination,
The essential idea of revolution is a change in the form of government or constitution, or a change of rulers,
otherwise than as provided by the laws of succession, election, etc.; while such change is apt to involve armed
hostilities, these make no necessary part of the revolution. The revolution by which Dom Pedro was
dethroned, and Brazil changed from an empire to a republic, was accomplished without a battle, and almost
without a shot. Anarchy refers to the condition of a state when human government is superseded or destroyed
by factions or other causes. Lawlessness is a temper of mind or condition of the community which may result
in anarchy. Confusion, disorder, riot, and tumult are incidental and temporary outbreaks of lawlessness, but
may not be anarchy. Insubordination is individual disobedience. Sedition is the plotting, rebellion the
fighting, against the existing government, but always with the purpose of establishing some other government
in its place. When rebellion is successful it is called revolution; but there may be revolution without rebellion;
as, the English Revolution of 1688. A revolt is an uprising against existing authority without the
comprehensive views of change in the form or administration of government that are involved in revolution.
Anarchy, when more than temporary disorder, is a proposed disintegration of society, in which it is imagined
that social order might exist without government. Slaves make insurrection; soldiers or sailors break out in
mutiny; subject provinces rise in revolt. Compare SOCIALISM.
Antonyms:
authority, domination, government, obedience, sovereignty, command, dominion, law, order, submission,
control, empire, loyalty, rule, supremacy.
* * * * *
REVOLVE.
Synonyms:
roll, rotate, turn.
Any round body rolls which continuously touches with successive portions of its surface successive portions
of another surface; a wagon-wheel rolls along the ground. To rotate is said of a body that has a circular
motion about its own center or axis; to revolve is said of a body that moves in a curving path, as a circle or an
ellipse, about a center outside of itself, so as to return periodically to the same relative position that it held at
some previous time. A revolving body may also either rotate or roll at the same time; the earth revolves
around the sun, and rotates on its own axis; in popular usage, the earth is often said to revolve about its own
axis, or to have a daily "revolution," but rotate and "rotation" are the more accurate terms. A cylinder over
which an endless belt is drawn is said to roll as regards the belt, tho it rotates as regards its own axis. Any
object that is in contact with or connected with a rolling body is often said to roll; as, the car rolls smoothly
along the track. Objects whose motion approximates or suggests a rotary motion along a supporting surface
are also said to roll; as, ocean waves roll in upon the shore, or the ship rolls in the trough of the sea. Turn is a
conversational and popular word often used vaguely for rotate or revolve, or for any motion about a fixed
point, especially for a motion less than a complete "rotation" or "revolution;" a man turns his head or turns on
his heel; the gate turns on its hinges.
Antonyms:
bind, chafe, grind, slide, slip, stand, stick.
* * * * *
RIDDLE, n.
Synonyms:
conundrum, enigma, paradox, problem, puzzle.
Conundrum, a word of unknown origin, signifies some question or statement in which some hidden and
fanciful resemblance is involved, the answer often depending upon a pun; an enigma is a dark saying; a
paradox is a true statement that at first appears absurd or contradictory; a problem is something thrown out for
solution; puzzle (from oppose) referred originally to the intricate arguments by which disputants opposed each
other in the old philosophic schools. The riddle is an ambiguous or paradoxical statement with a hidden
meaning to be guessed by the mental acuteness of the one to whom it is proposed; the riddle is not so petty as
the conundrum, and may require much acuteness for its answer; a problem may require simply study and
scholarship, as a problem in mathematics; a puzzle may be in something other than verbal statement, as a
dissected map or any perplexing mechanical contrivance. Both enigma and puzzle may be applied to any
matter difficult of answer or solution, enigma conveying an idea of greater dignity, puzzle applying to
something more commonplace and mechanical; there are many dark enigmas in human life and in the course
of providence; the location of a missing object is often a puzzle.
Antonyms:
answer, axiom, explanation, proposition, solution.
* * * * *
RIGHT, n.
Synonyms:
claim, franchise, liberty, prerogative, exemption, immunity, license, privilege.
A right is that which one may properly demand upon considerations of justice, morality, equity, or of natural
or positive law. A right may be either general or special, natural or artificial. "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness" are the natural and inalienable rights of all men; rights of property, inheritance, etc., are individual
and special, and often artificial, as the right of inheritance by primogeniture. A privilege is always special,
exceptional, and artificial; it is something not enjoyed by all, or only to be enjoyed on certain special
conditions, a peculiar benefit, favor, advantage, etc. A privilege may be of doing or avoiding; in the latter case
it is an exemption or immunity; as, a privilege of hunting or fishing; exemption from military service;
immunity from arrest. A franchise is a specific right or privilege granted by the government or established as
such by governmental authority; as, the elective franchise; a railroad franchise. A prerogative is an official
right or privilege, especially one inherent in the royal or sovereign power; in a wider sense it is an exclusive
and peculiar privilege which one possesses by reason of being what he is; as, reason is the prerogative of man;
kings and nobles have often claimed prerogatives and privileges opposed to the inherent rights of the people.
Compare DUTY; JUSTICE.
* * * * *
RISE.
Synonyms:
arise, ascend, emanate, flow, issue, proceed, spring.
To rise is to move up or upward whether slowly or quickly, whether through the least or greatest distance; the
waves rise; the mists rise; the river rises after heavy rains; as said of persons, to rise is to come to an erect
position after kneeling, sitting, reclining, or lying down; as, to rise from a sick-bed; my friend rose as I
entered; the guests rose to depart; so a deliberative assembly or a committee is said to rise when it breaks up a
session; a sun or star rises when to our apprehension it comes above the horizon and begins to go up the sky.
To ascend is to go far upward, and is often used in a stately sense; as, Christ ascended to heaven. The shorter
form rise is now generally preferred to the longer form arise, except in poetic or elevated style. The sun rises
or arises; the river springs at a bound from the foot of the glacier and flows through the lands to the ocean.
Smoke issues from a chimney and ascends toward the sky. Light and heat emanate from the sun.
Antonyms:
decline, descend, drop, fall, go down, set, settle, sink.
Prepositions:
Rise from slumber; rise to duty; rise at the summons; we rose with the lark.
* * * * *
ROBBER.
Synonyms:
bandit, depredator, freebooter, pirate, brigand, despoiler, highwayman, plunderer, buccaneer, footpad,
marauder, raider, burglar, forager, pillager, thief.
A robber seeks to obtain the property of others by force or intimidation; a thief by stealth and secrecy. In early
English thief was freely used in both senses, as in Shakespeare and the Authorized Version of the English
Bible, which has "two thieves" (Matt. xxvii, 38), where the Revised Version more correctly substitutes "two
robbers."
* * * * *
ROYAL.
Synonyms:
august, kingly, majestic, princely, kinglike, magnificent, munificent, regal.
Royal denotes that which actually belongs or pertains to a monarch; the royal residence is that which the king
occupies, royal raiment that which the king wears. Regal denotes that which in outward state is appropriate
for a king; a subject may assume regal magnificence in residence, dress, and equipage. Kingly denotes that
which is worthy of a king in personal qualities, especially of character and conduct; as, a kingly bearing; a
kingly resolve. Princely is especially used of treasure, expenditure, gifts, etc., as princely munificence, a
princely fortune, where regal could not so well be used and royal would change the sense. The distinctions
between these words are not absolute, but the tendency of the best usage is as here suggested.
Antonyms:
beggarly, contemptible, mean, poor, servile, slavish, vile.
* * * * *
RUSTIC.
Synonyms:
agricultural, coarse, pastoral, uncouth, artless, countrified, plain, unpolished, awkward, country, rude,
unsophisticated, boorish, hoidenish, rural, untaught, bucolic, inelegant, sylvan, verdant. clownish, outlandish,
Rural and rustic are alike derived from the Latin rus, country, and may be alike defined as pertaining to,
characteristic of, or dwelling in the country; but in usage rural refers especially to scenes or objects in the
country, considered as the work of nature; rustic refers to their effect upon man or to their condition as
affected by human agency; as, a rural scene; a rustic party; a rustic lass. We speak, however, of the rural
population, rural simplicity, etc. Rural has always a favorable sense; rustic frequently an unfavorable one, as
denoting a lack of culture and refinement; thus, rustic politeness expresses that which is well-meant, but
awkward; similar ideas are suggested by a rustic feast, rustic garb, etc. Rustic is, however, often used of a
studied simplicity, an artistic rudeness, which is pleasing and perhaps beautiful; as, a rustic cottage; a rustic
chair. Pastoral refers to the care of flocks, and to the shepherd's life with the pleasing associations suggested
by the old poetic ideal of that life; as, pastoral poetry. Bucolic is kindred to pastoral, but is a less elevated
term, and sometimes slightly contemptuous.
Antonyms:
accomplished, cultured, polished, refined, urbane, city-like, elegant, polite, urban, well-bred.
* * * * *
SACRAMENT.
Synonyms:
ceremony, eucharist, observance, rite, solemnity. communion, Lord's Supper, ordinance, service,
Any religious act, especially a public act, viewed as a means of serving God is called a service; the word
commonly includes the entire series of exercises of a single occasion of public worship. A religious service
ordained as an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace is called a sacrament. Ceremony is a
form expressing reverence, or at least respect; we may speak of religious ceremonies, the ceremonies of polite
society, the ceremonies of a coronation, an inauguration, etc. An observance has more than a formal
obligation, reaching or approaching a religious sacredness; a stated religious observance, viewed as
established by authority, is called an ordinance; viewed as an established custom, it is a rite. The terms
sacrament and ordinance, in the religious sense, are often used interchangeably; the ordinance derives its
sacredness from the authority that ordained it, while the sacrament possesses a sacredness due to something in
itself, even when viewed simply as a representation or memorial. The Lord's Supper is the Scriptural name for
the observance commemorating the death of Christ; the word communion is once applied to it (1 Cor. x, 16),
but not as a distinctive name; at an early period, however, the name communion was so applied, as denoting
the communing of Christians with their Lord, or with one another. The term eucharist describes the Lord's
Supper as a thanksgiving service; it is also called by preeminence the sacrament, as the ratifying of a solemn
vow of consecration to Christ.
* * * * *
SAGACIOUS.
Synonyms:
able, intelligent, perspicacious, sensible, acute, keen, quick of scent, sharp, apt, keen-sighted, quick-scented,
sharp-witted, clear-sighted, keen-witted, rational, shrewd, discerning, judicious, sage, wise.
Sagacious refers to a power of tracing the hidden or recondite by slight indications, as by instinct or intuition;
it is not now applied to mere keenness of sense-perception. We do not call a hound sagacious in following a
clear trail; but if he loses the scent, as at the edge of a stream, and circles around till he strikes it again, his
conduct is said to be sagacious. In human affairs sagacious refers to a power of ready, far-reaching, and
accurate inference from observed facts perhaps in themselves very slight, that seems like a special sense; or to
a similar readiness to foresee the results of any action, especially upon human motives or conduct--a kind of
prophetic common sense. Sagacious is a broader and nobler word than shrewd, and not capable of the
invidious sense which the latter word often bears; on the other hand, sagacious is less lofty and
comprehensive than wise in its full sense, and more limited to matters of direct practical moment. Compare
ASTUTE; WISDOM.
Antonyms:
absurd, futile, obtuse, silly, sottish, undiscerning, dull, ignorant, senseless, simple, stupid, unintelligent.
foolish, irrational,
* * * * *
SALE.
Synonyms:
bargain, barter, change, deal, exchange, trade.
A bargain is strictly an agreement or contract to buy and sell, tho the word is often used to denote the entire
transaction and also as a designation for the thing sold or purchased. Change and exchange are words of wider
signification, applying only incidentally to the transfer of property or value; a change secures something
different in any way or by any means; an exchange secures something as an equivalent or return, tho not
necessarily as payment for what is given. Barter is the exchange of one commodity for another, the word
being used generally with reference to portable commodities. Trade in the broad sense may apply to vast
businesses (as the book-trade), but as denoting a single transaction is used chiefly in regard to things of
moderate value, when it becomes nearly synonymous with barter. Sale is commonly, and with increasing
strictness, limited to the transfer of property for money, or for something estimated at a money value or
considered as equivalent to so much money in hand or to be paid. A deal in the political sense is a bargain,
substitution, or transfer for the benefit of certain persons or parties against all others; as, the nomination was
the result of a deal; in business it may have a similar meaning, but it frequently signifies simply a sale or
exchange, a dealing; as, a heavy deal in stocks.
* * * * *
SAMPLE.
Synonyms:
case, exemplification, instance, example, illustration, specimen.
A sample is a portion taken at random out of a quantity supposed to be homogeneous, so that the qualities
found in the sample may reasonably be expected to be found in the whole; as, a sample of sugar; a sample of
cloth. A specimen is one unit of a series, or a fragment of a mass, all of which is supposed to possess the same
essential qualities; as, a specimen of coinage, or of architecture, or a specimen of quartz. No other unit or
portion may be exactly like the specimen, while all the rest is supposed to be exactly like the sample. An
instance is a sample or specimen of action. Compare EXAMPLE.
Antonyms:
abnormality, aggregate, exception, monstrosity, total, whole.
* * * * *
SATISFY.
Synonyms:
cloy, fill, sate, suffice, content, glut, satiate, surfeit.
To satisfy is to furnish just enough to meet physical, mental, or spiritual desire. To sate or satiate is to gratify
desire so fully as for a time to extinguish it. To cloy or surfeit is to gratify to the point of revulsion or disgust.
Glut is a strong but somewhat coarse word applied to the utmost satisfaction of vehement appetites and
passions; as, to glut a vengeful spirit with slaughter; we speak of glutting the market with a supply so
excessive as to extinguish the demand. Much less than is needed to satisfy may suffice a frugal or abstemious
person; less than a sufficiency may content one of a patient and submissive spirit. Compare PAY; REQUITE.
Antonyms:
check, disappoint, restrain, starve, straiten, deny, refuse, restrict, stint, tantalize.
Prepositions:
Satisfy with food, with gifts, etc.; satisfy one (in the sense of make satisfaction) for labors and sacrifices;
satisfy oneself by or upon inquiry.
* * * * *
SCHOLAR.
Synonyms:
disciple, learner, pupil, savant, student.
The primary sense of a scholar is one who is being schooled; thence the word passes to denote one who is apt
in school work, and finally one who is thoroughly schooled, master of what the schools can teach, an erudite,
accomplished person: when used without qualification, the word is generally understood in this latter sense;
as, he is manifestly a scholar. Pupil signifies one under the close personal supervision or instruction of a
teacher or tutor. Those under instruction in schools below the academic grade are technically and officially
termed pupils. The word pupil is uniformly so used in the Reports of the Commissioner of Education of the
United States, but popular American usage prefers scholar in the original sense; as, teachers and scholars
enjoyed a holiday. Those under instruction in Sunday-schools are uniformly designated as Sunday-school
scholars. Student is applied to those in the higher grades or courses of study, as the academic, collegiate,
scientific, etc. Student suggests less proficiency than scholar in the highest sense, the student being one who is
learning, the scholar one who has learned. On the other hand, student suggests less of personal supervision
than pupil; thus, the college student often becomes the private pupil of some instructor in special studies. For
disciple, etc., compare synonyms for ADHERENT.
Antonyms:
dunce, fool, idiot, idler, ignoramus, illiterate person.
* * * * *
SCIENCE.
Synonyms:
art, knowledge.
Knowledge of a single fact, not known as related to any other, or of many facts not known as having any
mutual relations or as comprehended under any general law, does not reach the meaning of science; science is
knowledge reduced to law and embodied in system. The knowledge of various countries gathered by an
observant traveler may be a heterogeneous medley of facts, which gain real value only when coordinated and
arranged by the man of science. Art always relates to something to be done, science to something to be
known. Not only must art be discriminated from science, but art in the industrial or mechanical sense must be
distinguished from art in the esthetic sense; the former aims chiefly at utility, the latter at beauty. The
mechanic arts are the province of the artisan, the esthetic or fine arts are the province of the artist; all the
industrial arts, as of weaving or printing, arithmetic or navigation, are governed by exact rules. Art in the
highest esthetic sense, while it makes use of rules, transcends all rule; no rules can be given for the production
of a painting like Raffael's "Transfiguration," a statue like the Apollo Belvedere, or a poem like the Iliad.
Science does not, like the mechanic arts, make production its direct aim, yet its possible productive
application in the arts is a constant stimulus to scientific investigation; the science, as in the case of chemistry
or electricity, is urged on to higher development by the demands of the art, while the art is perfected by the
advance of the science. Creative art seeking beauty for its own sake is closely akin to pure science seeking
knowledge for its own sake. Compare KNOWLEDGE; LITERATURE.

SECURITY.
Synonyms:
bail, earnest, gage, pledge, surety.
The first four words agree in denoting something given or deposited as an assurance of something to be given,
paid, or done. An earnest is of the same kind as that to be given, a portion of it delivered in advance, as when
part of the purchase-money is paid, according to the common expression, "to bind the bargain." A pledge or
security may be wholly different in kind from that to be given or paid, and may greatly exceed it in value.
Security may be of real or personal property--anything of sufficient value to make the creditor secure; a
pledge is always of personal property or chattels. Every pawnshop contains unredeemed pledges; land,
merchandise, bonds, etc., are frequently offered and accepted as security. A person may become security or
surety for another's payment of a debt, appearance in court, etc.; in the latter case, he is said to become bail for
that person; the person accused gives bail for himself. Gage survives only as a literary word, chiefly in certain
phrases; as, "the gage of battle."
Prepositions:
Security for the payment of a debt; security to the state, for the prisoner, in the sum of a thousand dollars.
* * * * *
SELF-ABNEGATION.
Synonyms:
self-control, self-devotion, self-renunciation, self-denial, self-immolation, self-sacrifice.
Self-control is holding oneself within due limits in pleasures and duties, as in all things else; self-denial, the
giving up of pleasures for the sake of duty. Self-renunciation surrenders conscious rights and claims;
self-abnegation forgets that there is anything to surrender. There have been devotees who practised very little
self-denial with very much self-renunciation. A mother will care for a sick child with complete
self-abnegation, but without a thought of self-denial. Self-devotion is heart-consecration of self to a person or
cause with readiness for any needed sacrifice. Self-sacrifice is the strongest and completest term of all, and
contemplates the gift of self as actually made. We speak of the self-sacrifice of Christ, where any other of the
above terms would be feeble or inappropriate.
Antonyms:
self-gratification, selfishness, self-seeking, self-will. self-indulgence,
* * * * *
SEND.
Synonyms:
cast, despatch, emit, impel, propel, dart, discharge, fling, lance, sling, delegate, dismiss, forward, launch,
throw, depute, drive, hurl, project, transmit.
To send is to cause to go or pass from one place to another, and always in fact or thought away from the agent
or agency that controls the act. Send in its most common use involves personal agency without personal
presence; according to the adage, "If you want your business done, go; if not, send;" one sends a letter or a
bullet, a messenger or a message. In all the derived uses this same idea controls; if one sends a ball into his
own heart, the action is away from the directing hand, and he is viewed as the passive recipient of his own act;
it is with an approach to personification that we speak of the bow sending the arrow, or the gun the shot. To
despatch is to send hastily or very promptly, ordinarily with a destination in view; to dismiss is to send away
from oneself without reference to a destination; as, to dismiss a clerk, an application, or an annoying subject.
To discharge is to send away so as to relieve a person or thing of a load; we discharge a gun or discharge the
contents; as applied to persons, discharge is a harsher term than dismiss. To emit is to send forth from within,
with no reference to a destination; as, the sun emits light and heat. Transmit, from the Latin, is a dignified
term, often less vigorous than the Saxon send, but preferable at times in literary or scientific use; as, to
transmit the crown, or the feud, from generation to generation; to transmit a charge of electricity. Transmit
fixes the attention more on the intervening agency, as send does upon the points of departure and destination.
Antonyms:
bring, convey, give, hold, receive, carry, get, hand, keep, retain.
Prepositions:
To send from the hand to or toward (rarely at) a mark; send to a friend by a messenger or by mail; send a
person into banishment; send a shell among the enemy.
* * * * *
SENSATION.
Synonyms:
emotion, feeling, perception, sense.
Sensation is the mind's consciousness due to a bodily affection, as of heat or cold; perception is the cognition
of some external object which is the cause or occasion of the sensation; the sensation of heat may be
connected with the perception of a fire. While sensations are connected with the body, emotions, as joy, grief,
etc., are wholly of the mind. "As the most of them [the sensations] are positively agreeable or the opposite,
they are nearly akin to those emotions, as hope or terror, or those passions, as anger and envy, which are
acknowledged by all to belong exclusively to the spirit, and to involve no relation whatever to matter or the
bodily organism. Such feelings are not infrequently styled sensations, though improperly." PORTER Human
Intellect  112, p. 128. [S. '90.] Feeling is a general term popularly denoting what is felt, whether through the
body or by the mind alone, and includes both sensation and emotion. A sense is an organ or faculty of
sensation or of perception.
* * * * *
SENSIBILITY.
Synonyms:
feeling, impressibility, sensitiveness, susceptibility.
Sensibility in the philosophical sense, denotes the capacity of emotion or feeling, as distinguished from the
intellect and the will. (Compare synonyms for SENSATION.) In popular use sensibility denotes sometimes
capacity of feeling of any kind; as, sensibility to heat or cold; sometimes, a peculiar readiness to be the subject
of feeling, especially of the higher feelings; as, the sensibility of the artist or the poet; a person of great or fine
sensibility. Sensitiveness denotes an especial delicacy of sensibility, ready to be excited by the slightest cause,
as displayed, for instance, in the "sensitive-plant." Susceptibility is rather a capacity to take up, receive, and,
as it were, to contain feeling, so that a person of great susceptibility is capable of being not only readily but
deeply moved; sensitiveness is more superficial, susceptibility more pervading. Thus, in physics, the
sensitiveness of a magnetic needle is the ease with which it may be deflected, as by another magnet; its
susceptibility is the degree to which it can be magnetized by a given magnetic force or the amount of
magnetism it will hold. So a person of great sensitiveness is quickly and keenly affected by any external
influence, as by music, pathos, or ridicule, while a person of great susceptibility is not only touched, but
moved to his inmost soul.
Antonyms:
coldness, hardness, insensibility, numbness, unconsciousness. deadness,
Prepositions:
The sensibility of the organism to atmospheric changes.
* * * * *
SEVERE.
Synonyms:
austere, inflexible, rigorous, uncompromising, hard, morose, stern, unmitigated, harsh, relentless, stiff,
unrelenting, inexorable, rigid, strict, unyielding.
That is severe which is devoid of all softness, mildness, tenderness, indulgence or levity, or (in literature and
art) devoid of unnecessary ornament, amplification, or embellishment of any kind; as, a severe style; as said of
anything painful, severe signifies such as heavily taxes endurance or resisting power; as, a severe pain, fever,
or winter. Rigid signifies primarily stiff, resisting any effort to change its shape; a corpse is said to be rigid in
death; hence, in metaphorical sense, a rigid person or character is one that resists all efforts to change the will
or course of conduct; a rigid rule or statement is one that admits of no deviation. Rigorous is nearly akin to
rigid, but is a stronger word, having reference to action or active qualities, as rigid does to state or character; a
rigid rule may be rigorously enforced. Strict (L. stringo, bind) signifies bound or stretched tight, tense,
strenuously exact. Stern unites harshness and authority with strictness or severity; stern, as said even of
inanimate objects, suggests something authoritative or forbidding. Austere signifies severely simple or
temperate, strict in self-restraint or discipline, and similarly unrelenting toward others. We speak of austere
morality, rigid rules, rigorous discipline, stern commands, severe punishment, harsh speech or a harsh voice,
hard requirements, strict injunctions, and strict obedience. Strict discipline holds one exactly and
unflinchingly to the rule; rigorous discipline punishes severely any infraction of it. The austere character is
seldom lovely, but it is always strong and may be grand, commanding, and estimable.
Antonyms:
affable, easy, gentle, lenient, pliable, sweet, tractable, bland, genial, indulgent, mild, soft, tender, yielding.
* * * * *
SHAKE.
Synonyms:
agitate, jar, quake, shiver, totter, brandish, joggle, quaver, shudder, tremble, flap, jolt, quiver, sway, vibrate,
fluctuate, jounce, reel, swing, wave, flutter, oscillate, rock, thrill, waver.
A thing is shaken which is subjected to short and abruptly checked movements, as forward and backward, up
and down, from side to side, etc. A tree is "shaken with a mighty wind;" a man slowly shakes his head. A
thing rocks that is sustained from below; it swings if suspended from above, as a pendulum, or pivoted at the
side, as a crane or a bridge-draw; to oscillate is to swing with a smooth and regular returning motion; a
vibrating motion may be tremulous or jarring. The pendulum of a clock may be said to swing, vibrate, or
oscillate; a steel bridge vibrates under the passage of a heavy train; the term vibrate is also applied to
molecular movements. Jolting is a lifting from and letting down suddenly upon an unyielding surface; as, a
carriage jolts over a rough road. A jarring motion is abruptly and very rapidly repeated through an
exceedingly limited space; the jolting of the carriage jars the windows. Rattling refers directly to the sound
produced by shaking. To joggle is to shake slightly; as, a passing touch joggles the desk on which one is
writing. A thing trembles that shakes perceptibly and with an appearance of uncertainty and instability, as a
person under the influence of fear; a thing shivers when all its particles are stirred with a slight but pervading
tremulous motion, as a human body under the influence of cold; shuddering is a more pronounced movement
of a similar kind, in human beings often the effect of emotional or moral recoil; hence, the word is applied by
extension to such feelings even when they have no such outward manifestation; as, one says, "I shudder at the
thought." To quiver is to have slight and often spasmodic contractile motions, as the flesh under the surgeon's
knife. Thrill is applied to a pervasive movement felt rather than seen; as, the nerves thrill with delight; quiver
is similarly used, but suggests somewhat more of outward manifestation. To agitate in its literal use is nearly
the same as to shake, tho we speak of the sea as agitated when we could not say it is shaken; the Latin agitate
is preferred in scientific or technical use to the Saxon shake, and especially as applied to the action of
mechanical contrivances; in the metaphorical use agitate is more transitory and superficial, shake more
fundamental and enduring; a person's feelings are agitated by distressing news; his courage, his faith, his
credit, or his testimony is shaken. Sway applies to the movement of a body suspended from above or not
firmly sustained from below, and the motion of which is less pronounced than swinging, smoother than
vibrating, and not necessarily constant as oscillating; as, the swaying of a reed in the wind. Sway used
transitively especially applies to motions of grace or dignity; brandish denotes a threatening or hostile motion;
a monarch sways the scepter; the ruffian brandishes a club. To reel or totter always implies liability to fall;
reeling is more violent than swaying, tottering more irregular; a drunken man reels; we speak of the tottering
step of age or infancy. An extended mass which seems to lack solidity or cohesion is said to quake; as, a
quaking bog. Quaver is applied almost exclusively to tremulous sounds of the human voice. Flap, flutter, and
fluctuate refer to wave-like movements, flap generally to such as produce a sharp sound; a cock flaps his
wings; flutter applies to a less pronounced and more irregular motion; a captive bird or a feeble pulse flutters.
Compare FLUCTUATE.
* * * * *
SHELTER.
Synonyms:
cover, guard, protect, shield, defend, harbor, screen, ward.
Anything is covered over which something is completely extended; a vessel is covered with a lid; the head is
covered with a hat. That which covers may also defend or protect; thus, troops interposed between some
portion of their own army and the enemy are often called a covering party. To shelter is to cover so as to
protect from injury or annoyance; as, the roof shelters from the storm; woods shelter from the heat. To defend
(L. defendere, to strike away) implies the actual, protect (L. protegere, to cover before) implies the possible
use of force or resisting power; guard implies sustained vigilance with readiness for conflict; we defend a
person or thing against actual attack; we guard or protect against possible assault or injury. A powerful person
may protect one who is weak by simply declaring himself his friend; he defends him by some form of active
championship. An inanimate object may protect, as a garment from cold; defend is used but rarely, and by
somewhat violent metaphor, in such connection. Protect is more complete than guard or defend; an object
may be faithfully guarded or bravely defended in vain, but that which is protected is secure. To shield is to
interpose something over or before that which is assailed, so as to save from harm, and has a comparatively
passive sense; one may guard another by standing armed at his side, defend him by fighting for him, or shield
him from a missile or a blow by interposing his own person. Harbor is generally used in an unfavorable
sense; confederates or sympathizers harbor a criminal; a person harbors evil thoughts or designs. See
CHERISH. Compare synonyms for HIDE; DEFENSE.
Antonyms:
betray, expel, expose, give up, refuse, reject, surrender. cast out,
Prepositions:
Shelter under a roof from the storm; in the fortress, behind or within the walls, from attack.
* * * * *
SIGN.
Synonyms:
emblem, mark, presage, symbol, token, indication, note, prognostic, symptom, type. manifestation, omen,
signal,
A sign (L. signum) is any distinctive mark by which a thing may be recognized or its presence known, and
may be intentional or accidental, natural or artificial, suggestive, descriptive, or wholly arbitrary; thus, a blush
may be a sign of shame; the footprint of an animal is a sign that it has passed; the sign of a business house
now usually declares what is done or kept within, but formerly might be an object having no connection with
the business, as "the sign of the trout;" the letters of the alphabet are signs of certain sounds. While a sign may
be involuntary, and even unconscious, a signal is always voluntary, and is usually concerted; a ship may show
signs of distress to the casual observer, but signals of distress are a distinct appeal for aid. A symptom is a
vital phenomenon resulting from a diseased condition; in medical language a sign is an indication of any
physical condition, whether morbid or healthy; thus, a hot skin and rapid pulse are symptoms of pneumonia;
dulness of some portion of the lungs under percussion is one of the physical signs. Compare AUGUR;
CHARACTERISTIC; EMBLEM.

SIN.
Synonyms:
crime, fault, misdeed, vice, criminality, guilt, offense, viciousness, delinquency, ill-doing, transgression,
wickedness, depravity, immorality, ungodliness, wrong, evil, iniquity, unrighteousness, wrong-doing.
Sin is any lack of holiness, any defect of moral purity and truth, whether in heart or life, whether of
commission or omission. "All unrighteousness is sin," 1 John v, 17. Transgression, as its etymology indicates,
is the stepping over a specific enactment, whether of God or man, ordinarily by overt act, but in the broadest
sense, in volition or desire. Sin may be either act or state; transgression is always an act, mental or physical.
Crime is often used for a flagrant violation of right, but in the technical sense denotes specific violation of
human law. Guilt is desert of and exposure to punishment because of sin. Depravity denotes not any action,
but a perverted moral condition from which any act of sin may proceed. Sin in the generic sense, as denoting a
state of heart, is synonymous with depravity; in the specific sense, as in the expression a sin, the term may be
synonymous with transgression, crime, offense, misdeed, etc., or may denote some moral activity that could
not be characterized by terms so positive. Immorality denotes outward violation of the moral law. Sin is thus
the broadest word, and immorality next in scope; all crimes, properly so called, and all immoralities, are sins;
but there may be sin, as ingratitude, which is neither crime, transgression, nor immorality; and there may be
immorality which is not crime, as falsehood. Compare CRIMINAL.
Antonyms:
blamelessness, goodness, integrity, rectitude, sinlessness, excellence, holiness, morality, right, uprightness,
godliness, innocence, purity, righteousness, virtue.
Compare synonyms for VIRTUE.
* * * * *
SING.
Synonyms:
carol, chant, chirp, chirrup, hum, warble.
To sing is primarily and ordinarily to utter a succession of articulate musical sounds with the human voice.
The word has come to include any succession of musical sounds; we say the bird or the rivulet sings; we
speak of "the singing quality" of an instrument, and by still wider extension of meaning we say the teakettle or
the cricket sings. To chant is to sing in solemn and somewhat uniform cadence; chant is ordinarily applied to
non-metrical religious compositions. To carol is to sing joyously, and to warble (kindred with whirl) is to sing
with trills or quavers, usually also with the idea of joy. Carol and warble are especially applied to the singing
of birds. To chirp is to utter a brief musical sound, perhaps often repeated in the same key, as by certain small
birds, insects, etc. To chirrup is to utter a somewhat similar sound; the word is often used of a brief, sharp
sound uttered as a signal to animate or rouse a horse or other animal. To hum is to utter murmuring sounds
with somewhat monotonous musical cadence, usually with closed lips; we speak also of the hum of
machinery, etc.
* * * * *
SKEPTIC.
Synonyms:
agnostic, deist, doubter, infidel, unbeliever. atheist, disbeliever, freethinker,
The skeptic doubts divine revelation; the disbeliever and the unbeliever reject it, the disbeliever with more of
intellectual dissent, the unbeliever (in the common acceptation) with indifference or with opposition of heart
as well as of intellect. Infidel is an opprobrious term that might once almost have been said to be geographical
in its range. The Crusaders called all Mohammedans infidels, and were so called by them in return; the word
is commonly applied to any decided opponent of an accepted religion. The atheist denies that there is a God;
the deist admits the existence of God, but denies that the Christian Scriptures are a revelation from him; the
agnostic denies either that we do know or that we can know whether there is a God.
Antonyms:
believer, Christian.
* * * * *
SKETCH.
Synonyms:
brief, draft, outline, plan, design, drawing, picture, skeleton.
A sketch is a rough, suggestive presentation of anything, whether graphic or literary, commonly intended to be
preliminary to a more complete or extended treatment. An outline gives only the bounding or determining
lines of a figure or a scene; a sketch may give not only lines, but shading and color, but is hasty and
incomplete. The lines of a sketch are seldom so full and continuous as those of an outline, being, like the
shading or color, little more than indications or suggestions according to which a finished picture may be
made; the artist's first representation of a sunset, the hues of which change so rapidly, must of necessity be a
sketch. Draft and plan apply especially to mechanical drawing, of which outline, sketch, and drawing are also
used; a plan is strictly a view from above, as of a building or machine, giving the lines of a horizontal section,
originally at the level of the ground, now in a wider sense at any height; as, a plan of the cellar; a plan of the
attic. A mechanical drawing is always understood to be in full detail; a draft is an incomplete or unfinished
drawing; a design is such a preliminary sketch as indicates the object to be accomplished or the result to be
attained, and is understood to be original. One may make a drawing of any well-known mechanism, or a
drawing from another man's design; but if he says, "The design is mine," he claims it as his own invention or
composition. In written composition an outline gives simply the main divisions, and in the case of a sermon is
often called a skeleton; a somewhat fuller suggestion of illustration, treatment, and style is given in a sketch. A
lawyer's brief is a succinct statement of the main facts involved in a case, and of the main heads of his
argument on points of law, with reference to authorities cited; the brief has none of the vagueness of a sketch,
being sufficiently exact and complete to form, on occasion, the basis for the decision of the court without oral
argument, when the case is said to be "submitted on brief." Compare DESIGN.
* * * * *
SKILFUL.
Synonyms:
accomplished, apt, dexterous, happy, proficient, adept, clever, expert, ingenious, skilled, adroit, deft, handy,
practised, trained.
Skilful signifies possessing and using readily practical knowledge and ability, having alert and well-trained
faculties with reference to a given work. One is adept in that for which he has a natural gift improved by
practise; he is expert in that of which training, experience, and study have given him a thorough mastery; he is
dexterous in that which he can do effectively, with or without training, especially in work of the hand or
bodily activities. In the case of the noun, "an expert" denotes one who is "experienced" in the fullest sense, a
master of his branch of knowledge. A skilled workman is one who has thoroughly learned his trade, though he
may be naturally quite dull; a skilful workman has some natural brightness, ability, and power of adaptation,
in addition to his acquired knowledge and dexterity. Compare CLEVER; DEXTERITY; POWER.
Antonyms:
awkward, clumsy, inexpert, shiftless, unskilled, untrained. bungling, helpless, maladroit, unhandy, untaught,
Prepositions:
Skilful at or in a work, with a pen or tool of any kind.
* * * * *
SLANDER.
Synonyms:
asperse, decry, disparage, revile, backbite, defame, libel, traduce, calumniate, depreciate, malign, vilify.
To slander a person is to utter a false and injurious report concerning him; to defame is specifically and
directly to attack one's reputation; to defame by spoken words is to slander, by written words, to libel. To
asperse is, as it were, to bespatter with injurious charges; to malign is to circulate studied and malicious
attacks upon character; to traduce is to exhibit one's real or assumed traits in an odious light; to revile or vilify
is to attack with vile abuse. To disparage is to represent one's admitted good traits or acts as less praiseworthy
than they would naturally be thought to be, as for instance, by ascribing a man's benevolence to a desire for
popularity or display. To libel or slander is to make an assault upon character and repute that comes within the
scope of law; the slander is uttered, the libel written, printed, or pictured. To backbite is to speak something
secretly to one's injury; to calumniate is to invent as well as utter the injurious charge. One may "abuse,"
"assail," or vilify another to his face; he asperses, calumniates, slanders, or traduces him behind his back.
Antonyms:
defend, eulogize, extol, laud, praise, vindicate.
* * * * *
SLANG.
Synonyms:
cant, colloquialism, vulgarism, vulgarity.
A colloquialism is an expression not coarse or low, and perhaps not incorrect, but below the literary grade;
educated persons are apt to allow themselves some colloquialisms in familiar conversation, which they would
avoid in writing or public speaking. Slang, in the primary sense, denotes expressions that are either coarse and
rude in themselves or chiefly current among the coarser and ruder part of the community; there are also many
expressions current in special senses in certain communities that may be characterized as slang; as, college
slang; club slang; racing slang. In the evolution of language many words originally slang are adopted by good
writers and speakers, and ultimately take their place as accepted English. A vulgarism is an expression
decidedly incorrect, and the use of which is a mark of ignorance or low breeding. Cant, as used in this
connection, denotes the barbarous jargon used as a secret language by thieves, tramps, etc. Compare
DICTION; LANGUAGE.
* * * * *
SLOW.
Synonyms:
dawdling, dilatory, gradual, lingering, slack, delaying, drowsy, inactive, moderate, sluggish, deliberate, dull,
inert, procrastinating, tardy.
Slow signifies moving through a relatively short distance, or with a relatively small number of motions in a
given time; slow also applies to that which is a relatively long while in beginning or accomplishing
something; a watch or a clock is said to be slow when its indications are behind those of the standard time.
Tardy is applied to that which is behind the proper or desired time, especially in doing a work or arriving at a
place. Deliberate and dilatory are used of persons, tho the latter may be used also of things, as of a stream; a
person is deliberate who takes a noticeably long time to consider and decide before acting or who acts or
speaks as if he were deliberating at every point; a person is dilatory who lays aside, or puts off as long as
possible, necessary or required action; both words may be applied either to undertaking or to doing. Gradual
(L. gradus, a step) signifies advancing by steps, and refers to slow but regular and sure progression. Slack
refers to action that seems to indicate a lack of tension, as of muscle or of will, sluggish to action that seems as
if reluctant to advance.
Antonyms:
See synonyms for NIMBLE.
* * * * *
SNEER.
Synonyms:
fling, gibe, jeer, mock, scoff, taunt.
A sneer may be simply a contemptuous facial contortion, or it may be some brief satirical utterance that
throws a contemptuous side-light on what it attacks without attempting to prove or disprove; a depreciatory
implication may be given in a sneer such as could only be answered by elaborate argument or proof, which
would seem to give the attack undue importance:
Who can refute a sneer?
PALEY Moral Philosophy bk. v, ch. ix.
A fling is careless and commonly pettish; a taunt is intentionally insulting and provoking; the sneer is
supercilious; the taunt is defiant. The jeer and gibe are uttered; the gibe is bitter, and often sly or covert; the
jeer is rude and open. A scoff may be in act or word, and is commonly directed against that which claims
honor, reverence, or worship. Compare BANTER.
Preposition:
Only an essentially vicious mind is capable of a sneer at virtue.
* * * * *
SOCIALISM.
Synonyms:
collectivism, communism, fabianism.
Socialism, as defined by its advocates, is a theory of civil polity that aims to secure the reconstruction of
society, increase of wealth, and a more equal distribution of the products of labor through the public collective
ownership of land and capital (as distinguished from property), and the public collective management of all
industries. Its aim is extended industrial cooperation; socialism is a purely economic term, applying to
landownership and productive capital. Many socialists call themselves collectivists, and their system
collectivism. Communism would divide all things, including the profits of individual labor, among members of
the community; many of its advocates would abolish marriage and the family relation. Anarchism is properly
an antonym of socialism, as it would destroy, by violence if necessary, all existing government and social
order, leaving the future to determine what, if anything, should be raised upon their ruins.
* * * * *
SOUND.
Synonyms:
noise, note, tone.
Sound is the sensation produced through the organs of hearing or the physical cause of this sensation. Sound is
the most comprehensive word of this group, applying to anything that is audible. Tone is sound considered as
having some musical quality or as expressive of some feeling; noise is sound considered without reference to
musical quality or as distinctly unmusical or discordant. Thus, in the most general sense noise and sound
scarcely differ, and we say almost indifferently, "I heard a sound," or "I heard a noise." We speak of a fine,
musical, or pleasing sound, but never thus of a noise. In music, tone may denote either a musical sound or the
interval between two such sounds, but in the most careful usage the latter is now distinguished as the
"interval," leaving tone to stand only for the sound. Note in music strictly denotes the character representing a
sound, but in loose popular usage it denotes the sound also, and becomes practically equivalent to tone. Aside
from its musical use, tone is chiefly applied to that quality of the human voice by which feeling is expressed;
as, he spoke in a cheery tone; the word is similarly applied to the voices of birds and other animals, and
sometimes to inanimate objects. As used of a musical instrument, tone denotes the general quality of its
sounds collectively considered.
* * * * *
SPEAK.
Synonyms:
announce, converse, discourse, say, articulate, declaim, enunciate, talk, chat, declare, express, tell, chatter,
deliver, pronounce, utter.
To utter is to give forth as an audible sound, articulate or not. To talk is to utter a succession of connected
words, ordinarily with the expectation of being listened to. To speak is to give articulate utterance even to a
single word; the officer speaks the word of command, but does not talk it. To speak is also to utter words with
the ordinary intonation, as distinguished from singing. To chat is ordinarily to utter in a familiar,
conversational way; to chatter is to talk in an empty, ceaseless way like a magpie.
Prepositions:
Speak to (address) a person; speak with a person (converse with him); speak of or about a thing (make it the
subject of remark); speak on or upon a subject; in parliamentary language, speak to the question.
* * * * *
SPEECH.
Synonyms:
address, dissertation, oration, speaking, discourse, harangue, oratory, talk, disquisition, language, sermon,
utterance.
Speech is the general word for utterance of thought in language. A speech may be the delivering of one's
sentiments in the simplest way; an oration is an elaborate and prepared speech; a harangue is a vehement
appeal to passion, or a speech that has something disputatious and combative in it. A discourse is a set speech
on a definite subject, intended to convey instruction. Compare CONVERSATION; DICTION; LANGUAGE.
Antonyms:
hush, silence, speechlessness, stillness, taciturnity.
* * * * *
SPONTANEOUS.
Synonyms:
automatic, impulsive, involuntary, voluntary, free, instinctive, unbidden, willing.
That is spontaneous which is freely done, with no external compulsion and, in human actions, without special
premeditation or distinct determination of the will; that is voluntary which is freely done with distinct act of
will; that is involuntary which is independent of the will, and perhaps in opposition to it; a willing act is not
only in accordance with will, but with desire. Thus voluntary and involuntary, which are antonyms of each
other, are both partial synonyms of spontaneous. We speak of spontaneous generation, spontaneous
combustion, spontaneous sympathy, an involuntary start, an unbidden tear, voluntary agreement, willing
submission. A babe's smile in answer to that of its mother is spontaneous; the smile of a pouting child
wheedled into good humor is involuntary. In physiology the action of the heart and lungs is called
involuntary; the growth of the hair and nails is spontaneous; the action of swallowing is voluntary up to a
certain point, beyond which it becomes involuntary or automatic. In the fullest sense of that which is not only
without the will but distinctly in opposition to it, or compulsory, involuntary becomes an antonym, not only of
voluntary but of spontaneous; as, involuntary servitude. A spontaneous outburst of applause is of necessity an
act of volition, but so completely dependent on sympathetic impulse that it would seem frigid to call it
voluntary, while to call it involuntary would imply some previous purpose or inclination not to applaud.

SPY.
Synonyms:
detective, emissary, scout.
The scout and the spy are both employed to obtain information of the numbers, movements, etc., of an enemy.
The scout lurks on the outskirts of the hostile army with such concealment as the case admits of, but without
disguise; a spy enters in disguise within the enemy's lines. A scout, if captured, has the rights of a prisoner of
war; a spy is held to have forfeited all rights, and is liable, in case of capture, to capital punishment. An
emissary is rather political than military; sent rather to secretly influence opponents than to bring information
concerning them; so far as he does the latter, he is not only an emissary, but a spy.

STAIN.
Synonyms:
blot, discolor, dishonor, soil, sully, tinge, color, disgrace, dye, spot, tarnish, tint.
To color is to impart a color desired or undesired, temporary or permanent, or, in the intransitive use, to
assume a color in any way; as, he colored with shame and vexation. To dye is to impart a color intentionally
and with a view to permanence, and especially so as to pervade the substance or fiber of that to which it is
applied. To stain is primarily to discolor, to impart a color undesired and perhaps unintended, and which may
or may not be permanent. Thus, a character "dyed in the wool" is one that has received some early, permanent,
and pervading influence; a character stained with crime or guilt is debased and perverted. Stain is, however,
used of giving an intended and perhaps pleasing color to wood, glass, etc., by an application of
coloring-matter which enters the substance a little below the surface, in distinction from painting, in which
coloring-matter is spread upon the surface; dyeing is generally said of wool, yarn, cloth, or similar materials
which are dipped into the coloring liquid. Figuratively, a standard or a garment may be dyed with blood in
honorable warfare; an assassin's weapon is stained with the blood of his victim. To tinge is to color slightly,
and may also be used of giving a slight flavor, or a slight admixture of one ingredient or quality with another
that is more pronounced.
* * * * *
STATE.
Synonyms:
affirm, aver, declare, predicate, set forth, allege, avouch, depose, pronounce, specify, assert, avow, express,
propound, swear, asseverate, certify, inform, protest, tell, assure, claim, maintain, say, testify.
To state (L. sto, stand) is to set forth explicitly, formally, or particularly in speech or writing. Assert (L. ad, to,
and sero, bind) is strongly personal, signifying to state boldly and positively what the one making the
statement has not attempted and may not attempt to prove. Affirm has less of egotism than assert (as seen in
the word self-assertion), coming nearer to aver. It has more solemnity than declare, and more composure and
dignity than asseverate, which is to assert excitedly. In legal usage, affirm has a general agreement with
depose and testify; it differs from swear in not invoking the name of God. To assure is to state with such
authority and confidence as the speaker feels ought to make the hearer sure. Certify is more formal, and
applies rather to written documents or legal processes. Assure, certify, inform, apply to the person; affirm, etc.,
to the thing. Assert is combative; assure is conciliatory. I assert my right to cross the river; I assure my friend
it is perfectly safe. To aver is to state positively what is within one's own knowledge or matter of deep
conviction. One may assert himself, or assert his right to what he is willing to contend for; or he may assert in
discussion what he is ready to maintain by argument or evidence. To assert without proof is always to lay
oneself open to the suspicion of having no proof to offer, and seems to arrogate too much to one's personal
authority, and hence in such cases both the verb assert and its noun assertion have an unfavorable sense; we
say a mere assertion, a bare assertion, his unsupported assertion; he asserted his innocence has less force than
he affirmed or maintained his innocence. Affirm, state, and tell have not the controversial sense of assert, but
are simply declarative. To vindicate is to defend successfully what is assailed. Almost every criminal will
assert his innocence; the honest man will seldom lack means to vindicate his integrity.
Antonyms:
contradict, controvert, disprove, gainsay, refute, retract, contravene, deny, dispute, oppose, repudiate, waive.
* * * * *
STEEP.
Synonyms:
abrupt, high, precipitous, sharp, sheer.
High is used of simple elevation; steep is said only of an incline where the vertical measurement is sufficiently
great in proportion to the horizontal to make it difficult of ascent. Steep is relative; an ascent of 100 feet to the
mile on a railway is a steep grade; a rise of 500 feet to the mile makes a steep wagon-road; a roof is steep
when it makes with the horizontal line an angle of more than 45. A high mountain may be climbed by a
winding road nowhere steep, while a little hill may be accessible only by a steep path. A sharp ascent or
descent is one that makes a sudden, decided angle with the plane from which it starts; a sheer ascent or
descent is perpendicular, or nearly so; precipitous applies to that which is of the nature of a precipice, and is
used especially of a descent; abrupt is as if broken sharply off, and applies to either acclivity or declivity.
Compare HIGH.
Antonyms:
easy, flat, gentle, gradual, horizontal, level, low, slight.
* * * * *
STORM.
Synonyms:
agitation, disturbance, tempest.
A storm is properly a disturbance of the atmosphere, with or without rain, snow, hail, or thunder and
lightning. Thus we have rain-storm, snow-storm, etc., and by extension, magnetic storm. A tempest is a storm
of extreme violence, always attended with some precipitation, as of rain, from the atmosphere. In the moral
and figurative use, storm and tempest are not closely discriminated, except that tempest commonly implies
greater intensity. We speak of agitation of feeling, disturbance of mind, a storm of passion, a tempest of rage.
Antonyms:
calm, fair weather, hush, peace, serenity, stillness, tranquillity.
* * * * *
STORY.
Synonyms:
account, legend, narrative, recital, relation, anecdote, myth, novel, record, tale. incident, narration,
A story is the telling of some series of connected incidents or events, whether real or fictitious, in prose or
verse, orally or in writing; or the series of incidents or events thus related may be termed a story. In children's
talk, a story is a common euphemism for a falsehood. Tale is nearly synonymous with story, but is somewhat
archaic; it is used for an imaginative, legendary, or fictitious recital, especially if of ancient date; as, a fairy
tale; also, for an idle or malicious report; as, do not tell tales; "where there is no tale-bearer, the strife
ceaseth." Prov. xxvi, 20. An anecdote tells briefly some incident, assumed to be fact. If it passes close limits
of brevity, it ceases to be an anecdote, and becomes a narrative or narration. A traditional or mythical story
of ancient times is a legend. A history is often somewhat poetically called a story; as, the story of the
American civil war. Compare ALLEGORY; FICTION; HISTORY.
Antonyms:
annals, biography, chronicle, history, memoir.
* * * * *
STUPIDITY.
Synonyms:
apathy, insensibility, slowness, stupefaction, dulness, obtuseness, sluggishness, stupor.
Stupidity is sometimes loosely used for temporary dulness or partial stupor, but chiefly for innate and chronic
dulness and sluggishness of mental action, obtuseness of apprehension, etc. Apathy may be temporary, and be
dispelled by appeal to the feelings or by the presentation of an adequate motive, but stupidity is inveterate and
commonly incurable. Compare APATHY; IDIOCY; STUPOR.
Antonyms:
acuteness, brilliancy, keenness, sagacity, alertness, cleverness, quickness, sense, animation, intelligence,
readiness, sensibility.
* * * * *
STUPOR.
Synonyms:
apathy, fainting, stupefaction, syncope, asphyxia, insensibility, swoon, torpor, coma, lethargy, swooning,
unconsciousness.
Stupor is a condition of the body in which the action of the senses and faculties is suspended or greatly
dulled--weakness or loss of sensibility. The apathy of disease is a mental affection, a state of morbid
indifference; lethargy is a morbid tendency to heavy and continued sleep, from which the patient may perhaps
be momentarily aroused. Coma is a deep, abnormal sleep, from which the patient can not be aroused, or is
aroused only with difficulty, a state of profound insensibility, perhaps with full pulse and deep, stertorous
breathing, and is due to brain-oppression. Syncope or swooning is a sudden loss of sensation and of power of
motion, with suspension of pulse and of respiration, and is due to failure of heart-action, as from sudden
nervous shock or intense mental emotion. Insensibility is a general term denoting loss of feeling from any
cause, as from cold, intoxication, or injury. Stupor is especially profound and confirmed insensibility, properly
comatose. Asphyxia is a special form of syncope resulting from partial or total suspension of respiration, as in
strangulation, drowning, or inhalation of noxious gases.
* * * * *
SUBJECTIVE.
Synonym:
objective.
Subjective and objective are synonyms in but one point of view, being, for the most part, strictly antonyms.
Subjective signifies relating to the subject of mental states, that is, to the person who experiences them;
objective signifies relating to the object of mental states, that is, to something outside the perceiving mind; in
brief phrase it may be said that subjective relates to something within the mind, objective to something
without. A mountain, as a mass of a certain size, contour, color, etc., is an objective fact; the impression our
mind receives, the mental picture it forms of the mountain, is subjective. But this subjective impression may
become itself the object of thought (called "subject-object"), as when we compare our mental picture of the
mountain with our idea of a plain or river. The direct experiences of the soul, as joy, grief, hope, fear, are
purely subjective; the outward causes of these experiences, as prosperity, bereavement, disappointment, are
objective. That which has independent existence or authority apart from our experience or thought is said to
have objective existence or authority; thus we speak of the objective authority of the moral law. Different
individuals may receive different subjective impressions from the same objective fact, that which to one is a
cause of hope being to another a cause of fear, etc. The style of a writer is called objective when it derives its
materials mainly from or reaches out toward external objects; it is called subjective when it derives its
materials mainly from or constantly tends to revert to the personal experience of the author. Compare
INHERENT.
* * * * *
SUBSIDY.
Synonyms:
aid, bounty, indemnity, reward, support, allowance, gift, pension, subvention, tribute. bonus, grant, premium,
A subsidy is pecuniary aid directly granted by government to an individual or commercial enterprise, or
money furnished by one nation to another to aid it in carrying on war against a common enemy. A nation
grants a subsidy to an ally, pays a tribute to a conqueror. An indemnity is in the nature of things limited and
temporary, while a tribute might be exacted indefinitely. A nation may also grant a subsidy to its own citizens
as a means of promoting the public welfare; as, a subsidy to a steamship company. The somewhat rare term
subvention is especially applied to a grant of governmental aid to a literary or artistic enterprise.
Governmental aid to a commercial or industrial enterprise other than a transportation company is more
frequently called a bounty than a subsidy; as, the sugar bounty. The word bounty may be applied to almost any
regular or stipulated allowance by a government to a citizen or citizens; as, a bounty for enlisting in the army;
a bounty for killing wolves. A bounty is offered for something to be done; a pension is granted for something
that has been done.
* * * * *
SUBVERT.
Synonyms:
destroy, overthrow, ruin, supplant, extinguish, overturn, supersede, suppress.
To subvert is to overthrow from or as from the very foundation; utterly destroy; bring to ruin. The word is
now generally figurative, as of moral or political ruin. To supersede implies the putting of something that is
wisely or unwisely preferred in the place of that which is removed; to subvert does not imply substitution. To
supplant is more often personal, signifying to take the place of another, usually by underhanded means; one is
superseded by authority, supplanted by a rival. Compare ABOLISH.
Antonyms:
conserve, keep, perpetuate, preserve, sustain, uphold.
* * * * *
SUCCEED.
Synonyms:
achieve, attain, flourish, prevail, prosper, thrive, win.
A person succeeds when he accomplishes what he attempts, or attains a desired object or result; an enterprise
or undertaking succeeds that has a prosperous result. To win implies that some one loses, but one may succeed
where no one fails. A solitary swimmer succeeds in reaching the shore; if we say he wins the shore we
contrast him with himself as a possible loser. Many students may succeed in study; a few win the special
prizes, for which all compete. Compare FOLLOW.
Antonyms:
be defeated, come short, fail, fall short, lose, miss, miscarry.
* * * * *
SUGGESTION.
Synonyms:
hint, implication, innuendo, insinuation, intimation.
A suggestion (L. sub, under, and gero, bring) brings something before the mind less directly than by formal or
explicit statement, as by a partial statement, an incidental allusion, an illustration, a question, or the like.
Suggestion is often used of an unobtrusive statement of one's views or wishes to another, leaving
consideration and any consequent action entirely to his judgment, and is hence, in many cases, the most
respectful way in which one can convey his views to a superior or a stranger. A suggestion may be given
unintentionally, and even unconsciously, as when we say an author has "a suggestive style." An intimation is a
suggestion in brief utterance, or sometimes by significant act, gesture, or token, of one's meaning or wishes; in
the latter case it is often the act of a superior; as, God in his providence gives us intimations of his will. A hint
is still more limited in expression, and is always covert, but frequently with good intent; as, to give one a hint
of danger or of opportunity. Insinuation and innuendo are used in the bad sense; an insinuation is a covert or
partly veiled injurious utterance, sometimes to the very person attacked; an innuendo is commonly secret as
well as sly, as if pointing one out by a significant nod (L. in, in, to, and nuo, nod).
* * * * *
SUPERNATURAL.
Synonyms:
miraculous, preternatural, superhuman.
The supernatural (super, above) is above or superior to the recognized powers of nature; the preternatural
(preter, beyond) is aside from or beyond the recognized results or operations of natural law, often in the sense
of inauspicious; as, a preternatural gloom. Miraculous is more emphatic and specific than supernatural, as
referring to the direct personal intervention of divine power. Some hold that a miracle, as the raising of the
dead, is a direct suspension and even violation of natural laws by the fiat of the Creator, and hence is, in the
strictest sense, supernatural; others hold that the miracle is simply the calling forth of a power residing in the
laws of nature, but not within their ordinary operation, and dependent on a distinct act of God, so that the
miraculous might be termed "extranatural," rather than supernatural. All that is beyond human power is
superhuman; as, prophecy gives evidence of superhuman knowledge; the word is sometimes applied to
remarkable manifestations of human power, surpassing all that is ordinary.
Antonyms:
common, commonplace, everyday, natural, ordinary, usual.
* * * * *
SUPPORT.
Synonyms:
bear, cherish, keep, maintain, sustain, carry, hold up, keep up, prop, uphold.
Support and sustain alike signify to hold up or keep up, to prevent from falling or sinking; but sustain has a
special sense of continuous exertion or of great strength continuously exerted, as when we speak of sustained
endeavor or a sustained note; a flower is supported by the stem or a temple-roof by arches; the foundations of
a great building sustain an enormous pressure; to sustain life implies a greater exigency and need than to
support life; to say one is sustained under affliction is to say more both of the severity of the trial and the
completeness of the upholding than if we say he is supported. To bear is the most general word, denoting all
holding up or keeping up of any object, whether in rest or motion; in the derived senses it refers to something
that is a tax upon strength or endurance; as, to bear a strain; to bear pain or grief. To maintain is to keep in a
state or condition, especially in an excellent and desirable condition; as, to maintain health or reputation; to
maintain one's position; to maintain a cause or proposition is to hold it against opposition or difficulty. To
support may be partial, to maintain is complete; maintain is a word of more dignity than support; a man
supports his family; a state maintains an army or navy. To prop is always partial, signifying to add support to
something that is insecure. Compare ABET; ENDURE; KEEP.
Antonyms:
abandon, break down, demolish, destroy, let go, throw down, betray, cast down, desert, drop, overthrow,
wreck.
Prepositions:
The roof is supported by, on, or upon pillars; the family was supported on or upon a pittance, or by charity.
* * * * *
SUPPOSE.
Synonyms:
conjecture, deem, guess, imagine, surmise, think.
To suppose is temporarily to assume a thing as true, either with the expectation of finding it so or for the
purpose of ascertaining what would follow if it were so. To suppose is also to think a thing to be true while
aware or conceding that the belief does not rest upon any sure ground, and may not accord with fact; or yet
again, to suppose is to imply as true or involved as a necessary inference; as, design supposes the existence of
a designer. To conjecture is to put together the nearest available materials for a provisional opinion, always
with some expectation of finding the facts to be as conjectured. To imagine is to form a mental image of
something as existing, tho its actual existence may be unknown, or even impossible. To think, in this
application, is to hold as the result of thought what is admitted not to be matter of exact or certain knowledge;
as, I do not know, but I think this to be the fact: a more conclusive statement than would be made by the use of
conjecture or suppose. Compare DOUBT; HYPOTHESIS.
Antonyms:
ascertain, be sure, conclude, discover, know, prove.
* * * * *
SURRENDER.
Synonyms:
abandon, cede, give over, relinquish, alienate, give, give up, sacrifice, capitulate, give oneself up, let go, yield.
To surrender is to give up upon compulsion, as to an enemy in war, hence to give up to any person, passion,
influence, or power. To yield is to give place or give way under pressure, and hence under compulsion. Yield
implies more softness or concession than surrender; the most determined men may surrender to
overwhelming force; when one yields, his spirit is at least somewhat subdued. A monarch or a state cedes
territory perhaps for a consideration; surrenders an army, a navy, or a fortified place to a conqueror; a military
commander abandons an untenable position or unavailable stores. We sacrifice something precious through
error, friendship, or duty, yield to convincing reasons, a stronger will, winsome persuasion, or superior force.
Compare ABANDON.
* * * * *
SYNONYMOUS.
Synonyms:
alike, equivalent, like, similar, correspondent, identical, same, synonymic. corresponding, interchangeable,
Synonymous (Gr. syn, together, and onyma, name) strictly signifies being interchangeable names for the same
thing, or being one of two or more interchangeable names for the same thing; to say that two words are
synonymous is strictly to say they are alike, equivalent, identical, or the same in meaning; but the use of
synonymous in this strict sense is somewhat rare, and rather with reference to statements than to words.
To say that we are morally developed is synonymous with saying that we have reaped what some one has
suffered for us.
H. W. BEECHER Royal Truths p. 294. [T. & F. '66.]
In the strictest sense, synonymous words scarcely exist; rarely, if ever, are any two words in any language
equivalent or identical in meaning; where a difference in meaning can not easily be shown, a difference in
usage commonly exists, so that the words are not interchangeable. By synonymous words (or synonyms) we
usually understand words that coincide or nearly coincide in some part of their meaning, and may hence
within certain limits be used interchangeably, while outside of those limits they may differ very greatly in
meaning and use. It is the office of a work on synonyms to point out these correspondences and differences,
that language may have the flexibility that comes from freedom of selection within the common limits, with
the perspicuity and precision that result from exact choice of the fittest words to express each shade of
meaning outside of the common limits. To consider synonymous words identical is fatal to accuracy; to forget
that they are similar, to some extent equivalent, and sometimes interchangeable, is destructive of freedom and
variety.
* * * * *
SYSTEM.
Synonyms:
manner, method, mode, order, regularity, rule.
Order in this connection denotes the fact or result of proper arrangement according to the due relation or
sequence of the matters arranged; as, these papers are in order; in alphabetical order. Method denotes a
process, a general or established way of doing or proceeding in anything; rule, an authoritative requirement or
an established course of things; system, not merely a law of action or procedure, but a comprehensive plan in
which all the parts are related to each other and to the whole; as, a system of theology; a railroad system; the
digestive system; manner refers to the external qualities of actions, and to those often as settled and
characteristic; we speak of a system of taxation, a method of collecting taxes, the rules by which assessments
are made; or we say, as a rule the payments are heaviest at a certain time of year; a just tax may be made
odious by the manner of its collection. Regularity applies to the even disposition of objects or uniform
recurrence of acts in a series. There may be regularity without order, as in the recurrence of paroxysms of
disease or insanity; there may be order without regularity, as in the arrangement of furniture in a room, where
the objects are placed at varying distances. Order commonly implies the design of an intelligent agent or the
appearance or suggestion of such design; regularity applies to an actual uniform disposition or recurrence
with no suggestion of purpose, and as applied to human affairs is less intelligent and more mechanical than
order. The most perfect order is often secured with least regularity, as in a fine essay or oration. The same
may be said of system. There is a regularity of dividing a treatise into topics, paragraphs, and sentences, that is
destructive of true rhetorical system. Compare HABIT; HYPOTHESIS.
Antonyms:
chaos, derangement, disarrangement, disorder, irregularity. confusion,
* * * * *
TACITURN.
Synonyms:
close, mute, reticent, speechless, dumb, reserved, silent, uncommunicative.
Dumb, mute, silent and speechless refer to fact or state; taciturn refers to habit and disposition. The talkative
person may be stricken dumb with surprise or terror; the obstinate may remain mute; one may be silent
through preoccupation of mind or of set purpose; but the taciturn person is averse to the utterance of thought
or feeling and to communication with others, either from natural disposition or for the occasion. One who is
silent does not speak at all; one who is taciturn speaks when compelled, but in a grudging way that repels
further approach. Reserved suggests more of method and intention than taciturn, applying often to some
special time or topic; one who is communicative regarding all else may be reserved about his business.
Reserved is thus closely equivalent to uncommunicative, but is a somewhat stronger word, often suggesting
pride or haughtiness, as when we say one is reserved toward inferiors. Compare PRIDE.
Antonyms:
communicative, free, garrulous, loquacious, talkative, unreserved.
* * * * *
TASTEFUL.
Synonyms:
artistic, delicate, esthetic, fastidious, nice, chaste, delicious, esthetical, fine, tasty. dainty, elegant, exquisite,
Elegant (L. elegans, select) refers to that assemblage of qualities which makes anything choice to persons of
culture and refinement; it refers to the lighter, finer elements of beauty in form or motion, especially denoting
that which exhibits faultless taste and perfection of finish. That which is elegant is made so not merely by
nature, but by art and culture; a woodland dell may be beautiful or picturesque, but would not ordinarily be
termed elegant. Tasteful refers to that in which the element of taste is more prominent, standing, as it were,
more by itself, while in elegant it is blended as part of the whole. Tasty is an inferior word, used colloquially
in a similar sense. Chaste (primarily pure), denotes in literature and art that which is true to the higher and
finer feelings and free from all excess or meretricious ornament. Dainty and delicate refer to the lighter and
finer elements of taste and beauty, dainty tending in personal use to an excessive scrupulousness which is
more fully expressed by fastidious. Nice and delicate both refer to exact adaptation to some standard; the bar
of a balance can be said to be nicely or delicately poised; as regards matters of taste and beauty, delicate is a
higher and more discriminating word than nice, and is always used in a favorable sense; a delicate distinction
is one worth observing; a nice distinction may be so, or may be overstrained and unduly subtle; fine in such
use, is closely similar to delicate and nice, but (tho capable of an unfavorable sense) has commonly a
suggestion of positive excellence or admirableness; a fine touch does something; fine perceptions are to some
purpose; delicate is capable of the single unfavorable sense of frail or fragile; as, a delicate constitution.
Esthetic or esthetical refers to beauty or the appreciation of the beautiful, especially from the philosophic
point of view. Exquisite denotes the utmost perfection of the elegant in minute details; we speak of an elegant
garment, an exquisite lace. Exquisite is also applied to intense keenness of any feeling; as, exquisite delight;
exquisite pain. See BEAUTIFUL; DELICIOUS; FINE.
Antonyms:
clumsy, displeasing, grotesque, inartistic, rough, coarse, distasteful, harsh, inharmonious, rude, deformed,
fulsome, hideous, meretricious, rugged, disgusting, gaudy, horrid, offensive, tawdry.
* * * * *
TEACH.
Synonyms:
discipline, give instruction, inform, nurture, drill, give lessons, initiate, school, educate, inculcate, instill, train,
enlighten, indoctrinate, instruct, tutor.
To teach is simply to communicate knowledge; to instruct (originally, to build in or into, put in order) is to
impart knowledge with special method and completeness; instruct has also an authoritative sense nearly
equivalent to command. To educate is to draw out or develop harmoniously the mental powers, and, in the
fullest sense, the moral powers as well. To train is to direct to a certain result powers already existing. Train is
used in preference to educate when the reference is to the inferior animals or to the physical powers of man;
as, to train a horse; to train the hand or eye. To discipline is to bring into habitual and complete subjection to
authority; discipline is a severe word, and is often used as a euphemism for punish; to be thoroughly effective
in war, soldiers must be disciplined as well as trained. To nurture is to furnish the care and sustenance
necessary for physical, mental, and moral growth; nurture is a more tender and homelike word than educate.
Compare EDUCATION.
* * * * *
TEMERITY.
Synonyms:
audacity, heedlessness, presumption, foolhardiness, over-confidence, rashness, hardihood, precipitancy,
recklessness, hastiness, precipitation, venturesomeness.
Rashness applies to the actual rushing into danger without counting the cost; temerity denotes the needless
exposure of oneself to peril which is or might be clearly seen to be such. Rashness is used chiefly of bodily
acts, temerity often of mental or social matters; there may be a noble rashness, but temerity is always used in a
bad sense. We say it is amazing that one should have had the temerity to make a statement which could be
readily proved a falsehood, or to make an unworthy proposal to one sure to resent it; in such use temerity is
often closely allied to hardihood, audacity, or presumption. Venturesomeness dallies on the edge of danger
and experiments with it; foolhardiness rushes in for want of sense, heedlessness for want of attention,
rashness for want of reflection, recklessness from disregard of consequences. Audacity, in the sense here
considered, denotes a dashing and somewhat reckless courage, in defiance of conventionalities, or of other
men's opinions, or of what would be deemed probable consequences; as, the audacity of a successful
financier. Compare EFFRONTERY.
Antonyms:
care, circumspection, cowardice, hesitation, timidity, wariness. caution,
* * * * *
TERM.
Synonyms:
article, denomination, member, phrase, condition, expression, name, word.
Term in its figurative uses always retains something of its literal sense of a boundary or limit. The articles of a
contract or other instrument are simply the portions into which it is divided for convenience; the terms are the
essential statements on which its validity depends--as it were, the landmarks of its meaning or power; a
condition is a contingent term which may become fixed upon the happening of some contemplated event. In
logic a term is one of the essential members of a proposition, the boundary of statement in some one direction.
Thus, in general use term is more restricted than word, expression, or phrase; a term is a word that limits
meaning to a fixed point of statement or to a special class of subjects, as when we speak of the definition of
terms, that is of the key-words in any discussion; or we say, that is a legal or scientific term. Compare
BOUNDARY; DICTION.
* * * * *
TERSE.
Synonyms:
brief, concise, neat, short, compact, condensed, pithy, succinct. compendious, laconic, sententious,
Anything short or brief is of relatively small extent. That which is concise (L. con-, with, together, and cdo,
cut) is trimmed down, and that which is condensed (L. con-, with, together, and densus, thick) is, as it were,
pressed together, so as to include as much as possible within a small space. That which is compendious (L.
com-, together, and pendo, weigh) gathers the substance of a matter into a few words, weighty and effective.
The succinct (L. succinctus, from sub-, under, and cingo, gird; girded from below) has an alert effectiveness
as if girded for action. The summary is compacted to the utmost, often to the point of abruptness; as, we speak
of a summary statement or a summary dismissal. That which is terse (L. tersus, from tergo, rub off) has an
elegant and finished completeness within the smallest possible compass, as if rubbed or polished down to the
utmost. A sententious style is one abounding in sentences that are singly striking or memorable, apart from the
context; the word may be used invidiously of that which is pretentiously oracular. A pithy utterance gives the
gist of a matter effectively, whether in rude or elegant style.
Antonyms:
diffuse, lengthy, long, prolix, tedious, verbose, wordy.
* * * * *
TESTIMONY.
Synonyms:
affidavit, attestation, deposition, proof, affirmation, certification, evidence, witness.
Testimony, in legal as well as in common use, signifies the statements of witnesses. Deposition and affidavit
denote testimony reduced to writing; the deposition differs from the affidavit in that the latter is voluntary and
without cross-examination, while the former is made under interrogatories and subject to cross-examination.
Evidence is a broader term, including the testimony of witnesses and all facts of every kind that tend to prove
a thing true; we have the testimony of a traveler that a fugitive passed this way; his footprints in the sand are
additional evidence of the fact. Compare DEMONSTRATION; OATH.
* * * * *
THEREFORE.
Synonyms:
accordingly, consequently, then, whence, because, hence, thence, wherefore.
Therefore, signifying for that (or this) reason, is the most precise and formal word for expressing the direct
conclusion of a chain of reasoning; then carries a similar but slighter sense of inference, which it gives
incidentally rather than formally; as, "All men are mortal; Csar is a man; therefore Csar is mortal;" or,
"The contract is awarded; then there is no more to be said." Consequently denotes a direct result, but more
frequently of a practical than a theoretic kind; as, "Important matters demand my attention; consequently I
shall not sail to-day." Consequently is rarely used in the formal conclusions of logic or mathematics, but
marks rather the freer and looser style of rhetorical argument. Accordingly denotes correspondence, which
may or may not be consequence; it is often used in narration; as, "The soldiers were eager and confident;
accordingly they sprang forward at the word of command." Thence is a word of more sweeping inference than
therefore, applying not merely to a single set of premises, but often to all that has gone before, including the
reasonable inferences that have not been formally stated. Wherefore is the correlative of therefore, and
whence of hence or thence, appending the inference or conclusion to the previous statement without a break.

THRONG.
Synonyms:
concourse, crowd, host, jam, mass, multitude, press.
A crowd is a company of persons filling to excess the space they occupy and pressing inconveniently upon
one another; the total number in a crowd may be great or small. Throng is a word of vastness and dignity,
always implying that the persons are numerous as well as pressed or pressing closely together; there may be a
dense crowd in a small room, but there can not be a throng. Host and multitude both imply vast numbers, but
a multitude may be diffused over a great space so as to be nowhere a crowd; host is a military term, and
properly denotes an assembly too orderly for crowding. Concourse signifies a spontaneous gathering of many
persons moved by a common impulse, and has a suggestion of stateliness not found in the word crowd, while
suggesting less massing and pressure than is indicated by the word throng.
* * * * *
TIME.
Synonyms:
age, duration, epoch, period, sequence, term, date, eon, era, season, succession, while.
Sequence and succession apply to events viewed as following one another; time and duration denote
something conceived of as enduring while events take place and acts are done. According to the necessary
conditions of human thought, events are contained in time as objects are in space, time existing before the
event, measuring it as it passes, and still existing when the event is past. Duration and succession are more
general words than time; we can speak of infinite or eternal duration or succession, but time is commonly
contrasted with eternity. Time is measured or measurable duration.
* * * * *
TIP.
Synonyms:
cant, dip, incline, list, slope, careen, heel over, lean, slant, tilt.
To tilt or tip is to throw out of a horizontal position by raising one side or end or lowering the other; the words
are closely similar, but tilt suggests more of fluctuation or instability. Slant and slope are said of things
somewhat fixed or permanent in a position out of the horizontal or perpendicular; the roof slants, the hill
slopes. Incline is a more formal word for tip, and also for slant or slope. To cant is to set slantingly; in many
cases tip and cant might be interchanged, but tip is more temporary, often momentary; one tips a pail so that
the water flows over the edge; a mechanic cants a table by making or setting one side higher than the other. A
vessel careens in the wind; lists, usually, from shifting of cargo, from water in the hold, etc. Careening is
always toward one side or the other; listing may be forward or astern as well. To heel over is the same as to
careen, and must be distinguished from "keel over," which is to capsize.
* * * * *
TIRE.
Synonyms:
exhaust, fatigue, harass, jade, wear out, weary. fag,
To tire is to reduce strength in any degree by exertion; one may be tired just enough to make rest pleasant, or
even unconsciously tired, becoming aware of the fact only when he ceases the exertion; or, on the other hand,
he may be, according to the common phrase, "too tired to stir;" but for this extreme condition the stronger
words are commonly used. One who is fatigued suffers from a conscious and painful lack of strength as the
result of some overtaxing; an invalid may be fatigued with very slight exertion; when one is wearied, the
painful lack of strength is the result of long-continued demand or strain; one is exhausted when the strain has
been so severe and continuous as utterly to consume the strength, so that further exertion is for the time
impossible. One is fagged by drudgery; he is jaded by incessant repetition of the same act until it becomes
increasingly difficult or well-nigh impossible; as, a horse is jaded by a long and unbroken journey.
Antonyms:
invigorate, refresh, relax, relieve, repose, rest, restore. recreate,

TOOL.
Synonyms:
apparatus, implement, machine, utensil, appliance, instrument, mechanism, weapon.
A tool is something that is both contrived and used for extending the force of an intelligent agent to something
that is to be operated upon. Those things by which pacific and industrial operations are performed are alone
properly called tools, those designed for warlike purposes being designated weapons. An instrument is
anything through which power is applied and a result produced; in general usage, the word is of considerably
wider meaning than tool; as, a piano is a musical instrument. Instrument is the word usually applied to tools
used in scientific pursuits; as, we speak of a surgeon's or an optician's instruments. An implement is a
mechanical agency considered with reference to some specific purpose to which it is adapted; as, an
agricultural implement; implements of war. Implement is a less technical and artificial term than tool. The paw
of a tiger might be termed a terrible implement, but not a tool. A utensil is that which may be used for some
special purpose; the word is especially applied to articles used for domestic or agricultural purposes; as,
kitchen utensils; farming utensils. An appliance is that which is or may be applied to the accomplishment of a
result, either independently or as subordinate to something more extensive or important; every mechanical
tool is an appliance, but not every appliance is a tool; the traces of a harness are appliances for traction, but
they are not tools. Mechanism is a word of wide meaning, denoting any combination of mechanical devices
for united action. A machine in the most general sense is any mechanical instrument for the conversion of
motion; in this sense a lever is a machine; but in more commonly accepted usage a machine is distinguished
from a tool by its complexity, and by the combination and coordination of powers and movements for the
production of a result. A chisel by itself is a tool; when it is set so as to be operated by a crank and pitman, the
entire mechanism is called a machine; as, a mortising-machine. An apparatus may be a machine, but the word
is commonly used for a collection of distinct articles to be used in connection or combination for a certain
purpose--a mechanical equipment; as, the apparatus of a gymnasium; especially, for a collection of
appliances for some scientific purpose; as, a chemical or surgical apparatus; an apparatus may include many
tools, instruments, or implements. Implement is for the most part and utensil is altogether restricted to the
literal sense; instrument, machine, and tool have figurative use, instrument being used largely in a good, tool
always in a bad sense; machine inclines to the unfavorable sense, as implying that human agents are made
mechanically subservient to some controlling will; as, an instrument of Providence; the tool of a tyrant; a
political machine.
* * * * *
TOPIC.
Synonyms:
division, issue, motion, proposition, subject, head, matter, point, question, theme.
A topic (Gr. topos, place) is a head of discourse. Since a topic for discussion is often stated in the form of a
question, question has come to be extensively used to denote a debatable topic, especially of a practical
nature--an issue; as, the labor question; the temperance question. In deliberative assemblies a proposition
presented or moved for acceptance is called a motion, and such a motion or other matter for consideration is
known as the question, since it is or may be stated in interrogative form to be answered by each member with
a vote of "aye" or "no;" a member is required to speak to the question; the chairman puts the question. In
speaking or writing the general subject or theme may be termed the topic, tho it is more usual to apply the
latter term to the subordinate divisions, points, or heads of discourse; as, to enlarge on this topic would carry
me too far from my subject; a pleasant drive will suggest many topics for conversation.
* * * * *
TRACE.
Synonyms:
footmark, impression, remains, token, trail, footprint, mark, remnant, track, vestige. footstep, memorial, sign,
A memorial is that which is intended or fitted to bring to remembrance something that has passed away; it
may be vast and stately. On the other hand, a slight token of regard may be a cherished memorial of a friend;
either a concrete object or an observance may be a memorial. A vestige is always slight compared with that
whose existence it recalls; as, scattered mounds containing implements, weapons, etc., are vestiges of a former
civilization. A vestige is always a part of that which has passed away; a trace may be merely the mark made
by something that has been present or passed by, and that is still existing, or some slight evidence of its
presence or of the effect it has produced; as, traces of game were observed by the hunter. Compare
CHARACTERISTIC.
* * * * *
TRANSACT.
Synonyms:
accomplish, carry on, do, perform, act, conduct, negotiate, treat.
There are many acts that one may do, accomplish, or perform unaided; what he transacts is by means of or in
association with others; one may do a duty, perform a vow, accomplish a task, but he transacts business, since
that always involves the agency of others. To negotiate and to treat are likewise collective acts, but both these
words lay stress upon deliberation with adjustment of mutual claims and interests; transact, while it may
depend upon previous deliberation, states execution only. Notes, bills of exchange, loans, and treaties are said
to be negotiated, the word so used covering not merely the preliminary consideration, but the final settlement.
Negotiate has more reference to execution than treat; nations may treat of peace without result, but when a
treaty is negotiated, peace is secured; the citizens of the two nations are then free to transact business with
one another. Compare DO.
* * * * *
TRANSACTION.
Synonyms:
act, action, affair, business, deed, doing, proceeding.
One's acts or deeds may be exclusively his own; his transactions involve the agency or participation of others.
A transaction is something completed; a proceeding is or is viewed as something in progress; but since
transaction is often used to include the steps leading to the conclusion, while proceedings may result in
action, the dividing line between the two words becomes sometimes quite faint, tho transaction often
emphasizes the fact of something done, or brought to a conclusion. Both transactions and proceedings are
used of the records of a deliberative body, especially when published; strictly used, the two are distinguished;
as, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London give in full the papers read; the
Proceedings of the American Philological Association give in full the business done, with mere abstracts of or
extracts from the papers read. Compare ACT; BUSINESS.
* * * * *
TRANSCENDENTAL.
Synonyms:
a priori, intuitive, original, primordial, transcendent.
Intuitive truths are those which are in the mind independently of all experience, not being derived from
experience nor limited by it, as that the whole is greater than a part, or that things which are equal to the same
thing are equal to one another. All intuitive truths or beliefs are transcendental. But transcendental is a wider
term than intuitive, including all within the limits of thought that is not derived from experience, as the ideas
of space and time. "Being is transcendental.... As being can not be included under any genus, but transcends
them all, so the properties or affections of being have also been called transcendental." K.-F. Vocab. Philos.
p. 530. "Transcendent he [Kant] employed to denote what is wholly beyond experience, being neither given as
an a posteriori nor a priori element of cognition--what therefore transcends every category of thought." K.-F.
Vocab. Philos. p. 531. Transcendental has been applied in the language of the Emersonian school to the soul's
supposed intuitive knowledge of things divine and human, so far as they are capable of being known to man.
Compare MYSTERIOUS.
* * * * *
TRANSIENT.
Synonyms:
brief, fleeting, fugitive, short, ephemeral, flitting, momentary, temporary, evanescent, flying, passing,
transitory.
Transient and transitory are both derived from the same original source (L. trans, over, and eo, go), denoting
that which quickly passes or is passing away, but there is between them a fine shade of difference. A thing is
transient which in fact is not lasting; a thing is transitory which by its very nature must soon pass away; a
thing is temporary (L. tempus, time) which is intended to last or be made use of but a little while; as, a
transient joy; this transitory life; a temporary chairman. Ephemeral (Gr. epi, on, and hemera, day) literally
lasting but for a day, often marks more strongly than transient exceeding brevity of duration; it agrees with
transitory in denoting that its object is destined to pass away, but is stronger, as denoting not only its certain
but its speedy extinction; thus that which is ephemeral is looked upon as at once slight and perishable, and the
word carries often a suggestion of contempt; man's life is transitory, a butterfly's existence is ephemeral; with
no solid qualities or worthy achievements a pretender may sometimes gain an ephemeral popularity. That
which is fleeting is viewed as in the act of passing swiftly by, and that which is fugitive (L. fugio, flee) as
eluding attempts to detain it; that which is evanescent (L. evanesco, from e, out, and vanus, empty, vain) as in
the act of vanishing even while we gaze, as the hues of the sunset.
Antonyms:
abiding, eternal, immortal, lasting, perpetual, undying, enduring, everlasting, imperishable, permanent,
persistent, unfading.
* * * * *
UNION.
Synonyms:
coalition, conjunction, juncture, unification, combination, junction, oneness, unity.
Unity is oneness, the state of being one, especially of that which never has been divided or of that which can
not be conceived of as resolved into parts; as, the unity of God or the unity of the human soul. Union is a
bringing together of things that have been distinct, so that they combine or coalesce to form a new whole, or
the state or condition of things thus brought together; in a union the separate individuality of the things united
is never lost sight of; we speak of the union of the parts of a fractured bone or of the union of hearts in
marriage. But unity can be said of that which is manifestly or even conspicuously made up of parts, when a
single purpose or ideal is so subserved by all that their possible separateness is lost sight of; as, we speak of
the unity of the human body, or of the unity of the church. Compare ALLIANCE; ASSOCIATION;
ATTACHMENT; HARMONY; MARRIAGE.
Antonyms:
analysis, disconnection, disunion, divorce, separation, contrariety, disjunction, division, schism, severance.
decomposition, dissociation,
* * * * *
USUAL.
Synonyms:
accustomed, everyday, general, ordinary, public, common, familiar, habitual, prevailing, regular, customary,
frequent, normal, prevalent, wonted.
Usual (L. usus, use, habit, wont) signifies such as regularly or often recurs in the ordinary course of events, or
is habitually repeated in the life of the same person. Ordinary (L. ordo, order) signifies according to an
established order, hence of everyday occurrence. In strictness, common and general apply to the greater
number of individuals in a class; but both words are in good use as applying to the greater number of instances
in a series, so that it is possible to speak of one person's common practise or general custom, tho ordinary or
usual would in such case be preferable. Compare GENERAL; NORMAL.
Antonyms:
exceptional, infrequent, rare, strange, unparalleled, extraordinary, out-of-the-way, singular, uncommon,
unusual.
* * * * *
UTILITY.
Synonyms:
advantage, expediency, serviceableness, avail, profit, use, benefit, service, usefulness.
Utility (L. utilis, useful) signifies primarily the quality of being useful, but is somewhat more abstract and
philosophical than usefulness or use, and is often employed to denote adaptation to produce a valuable result,
while usefulness denotes the actual production of such result. We contrast beauty and utility. We say of an
invention, its utility is questionable, or, on the other hand, its usefulness has been proved by ample trial, or I
have found it of use; still, utility and usefulness are frequently interchanged. Expediency (L. ex, out, and pes,
foot; literally, the getting the foot out) refers primarily to escape from or avoidance of some difficulty or
trouble; either expediency or utility may be used to signify profit or advantage considered apart from right as
the ground of moral obligation, or of actions that have a moral character, expediency denoting immediate
advantage on a contracted view, and especially with reference to avoiding danger, difficulty, or loss, while
utility may be so broadened as to cover all existence through all time, as in the utilitarian theory of morals.
Policy is often used in a kindred sense, more positive than expediency but narrower than utility, as in the
proverb, "Honesty is the best policy." Compare PROFIT.
Antonyms:
disadvantage, futility, inadequacy, inutility, uselessness, folly, impolicy, inexpediency, unprofitableness,
worthlessness.
* * * * *
VACANT.
Synonyms:
blank, leisure, unfilled, untenanted, void, empty, unemployed, unoccupied, vacuous, waste.
That is empty which contains nothing; that is vacant which is without that which has filled or might be
expected to fill it; vacant has extensive reference to rights or possibilities of occupancy. A vacant room may
not be empty, and an empty house may not be vacant. Vacant, as derived from the Latin, is applied to things of
some dignity; empty, from the Saxon, is preferred in speaking of slight, common, or homely matters, tho it
may be applied with special force to the highest; we speak of empty space, a vacant lot, an empty dish, an
empty sleeve, a vacant mind, an empty heart, an empty boast, a vacant office, a vacant or leisure hour. Void
and devoid are rarely used in the literal sense, but for the most part confined to abstract relations, devoid being
followed by of, and having with that addition the effect of a prepositional phrase; as, the article is devoid of
sense; the contract is void for want of consideration. Waste, in this connection, applies to that which is made
so by devastation or ruin, or gives an impression of desolation, especially as combined with vastness,
probably from association of the words waste and vast: waste is applied also to uncultivated or unproductive
land, if of considerable extent; we speak of a waste track or region, but not of a waste city lot. Vacuous refers
to the condition of being empty or vacant, regarded as continuous or characteristic.
Antonyms:
brimful, busy, filled, inhabited, overflowing, brimmed, crammed, full, jammed, packed, brimming, crowded,
gorged, occupied, replete.
* * * * *
VAIN.
Synonyms:
abortive, futile, shadowy, unsatisfying, baseless, idle, trifling, unserviceable, bootless, inconstant, trivial,
unsubstantial, deceitful, ineffectual, unavailing, useless, delusive, nugatory, unimportant, vapid, empty, null,
unprofitable, visionary, fruitless, profitless, unreal, worthless.
Vain (L. vanus, empty) keeps the etymological idea through all changes of meaning; a vain endeavor is empty
of result, or of adequate power to produce a result, a vain pretension is empty or destitute of support, a vain
person has a conceit that is empty or destitute of adequate cause or reason. That which is bootless, fruitless, or
profitless fails to accomplish any valuable result; that which is abortive, ineffectual, or unavailing fails to
accomplish a result that it was, or was supposed to be, adapted to accomplish. That which is useless, futile, or
vain is inherently incapable of accomplishing a specified result. Useless, in the widest sense, signifies not of
use for any valuable purpose, and is thus closely similar to valueless and worthless. Fruitless is more final
than ineffectual, as applying to the sum or harvest of endeavor. That which is useless lacks actual fitness for a
purpose; that which is vain lacks imaginable fitness. Compare VACANT; OSTENTATION; PRIDE.
Antonyms:
adequate, effective, powerful, solid, useful, advantageous, efficient, profitable, sound, valid, beneficial,
expedient, real, substantial, valuable, competent, potent, serviceable, sufficient, worthy.

* * * * *
VENAL.
Synonyms:
hireling, mercenary, purchasable, salable.
Venal (L. venalis, from venum, sale) signifies ready to sell one's influence, vote, or efforts for money or other
consideration; mercenary (L. mercenarius, from merces, pay, reward) signifies influenced chiefly or only by
desire for gain or reward; thus, etymologically, the mercenary can be hired, while the venal are openly or
actually for sale; hireling (AS. hyrling, from hyr) signifies serving for hire or pay, or having the spirit or
character of one who works or of that which is done directly for hire or pay. Mercenary has especial
application to character or disposition; as, a mercenary spirit; mercenary motives--i. e., a spirit or motives to
which money is the chief consideration or the moving principle. The hireling, the mercenary, and the venal
are alike in making principle, conscience, and honor of less account than gold or sordid considerations; but the
mercenary and venal may be simply open to the bargain and sale which the hireling has already
consummated; a clergyman may be mercenary in making place and pay of undue importance while not venal
enough to forsake his own communion for another for any reward that could be offered him. The mercenary
may retain much show of independence; hireling service sacrifices self-respect as well as principle; a public
officer who makes his office tributary to private speculation in which he is interested is mercenary; if he
receives a stipulated recompense for administering his office at the behest of some leader, faction,
corporation, or the like, he is both hireling and venal; if he gives essential advantages for pay, without
subjecting himself to any direct domination, his course is venal, but not hireling. Compare PAY; VENIAL.
Antonyms:
disinterested, honest, incorruptible, public-spirited, generous, honorable, patriotic, unpurchasable.
* * * * *
VENERATE.
Synonyms:
adore, honor, respect, revere, reverence.
In the highest sense, to revere or reverence is to hold in mingled love and honor with something of sacred
fear, as for that which while lovely is sublimely exalted and brings upon us by contrast a sense of our
unworthiness or inferiority; to revere is a wholly spiritual act; to reverence is often, tho not necessarily, to
give outward expression to the reverential feeling; we revere or reverence the divine majesty. Revere is a
stronger word than reverence or venerate. To venerate is to hold in exalted honor without fear, and is applied
to objects less removed from ourselves than those we revere, being said especially of aged persons, of places
or objects having sacred associations, and of abstractions; we venerate an aged pastor, the dust of heroes or
martyrs, lofty virtue or self-sacrifice, or some great cause, as that of civil or religious liberty; we do not
venerate God, but revere or reverence him. We adore with a humble yet free outflowing of soul. Compare
VENERATION.
Antonyms:
contemn, detest, dishonor, scoff at, slight, despise, disdain, disregard, scorn, spurn.
* * * * *
VENERATION.
Synonyms:
adoration, awe, dread, reverence.
Awe is inspired by that in which there is sublimity or majesty so overwhelming as to awaken a feeling akin to
fear; in awe, considered by itself, there is no element of esteem or affection, tho the sense of vastness, power,
or grandeur in the object is always present. Dread is a shrinking apprehension or expectation of possible harm
awakened by any one of many objects or causes, from that which is overwhelmingly vast and mighty to that
which is productive of momentary physical pain; in its higher uses dread approaches the meaning of awe, but
with more of chilliness and cowering, and without that subjection of soul to the grandeur and worthiness of
the object that is involved in awe. Awe is preoccupied with the object that inspires it; dread with apprehension
of personal consequences. Reverence and veneration are less overwhelming than awe or dread, and suggest
something of esteem, affection, and personal nearness. We may feel awe of that which we can not reverence,
as a grandly terrible ocean storm; awe of the divine presence is more distant and less trustful than reverence.
Veneration is commonly applied to things which are not subjects of awe. Adoration, in its full sense, is loftier
than veneration, less restrained and awed than reverence, and with more of the spirit of direct, active, and
joyful worship. Compare ESTEEM; VENERATE.
Antonyms:
contempt, disdain, dishonor, disregard, scorn.
* * * * *
VENIAL.
Synonyms:
excusable, pardonable, slight, trivial.
Venial (L. venia, pardon) signifies capable of being pardoned, and, in common use, capable of being readily
pardoned, easily overlooked. Aside from its technical ecclesiastical use, venial is always understood as
marking some fault comparatively slight or trivial. A venial offense is one readily overlooked; a pardonable
offense requires more serious consideration, but on deliberation is found to be susceptible of pardon.
Excusable is scarcely applied to offenses, but to matters open to doubt or criticism rather than direct censure;
so used, it often falls little short of justifiable; as, I think, under those circumstances, his action was excusable.
Protestants do not recognize the distinction between venial and mortal sins. Venial must not be confounded
with the very different word VENAL. Compare VENAL.
Antonyms:
inexcusable, inexpiable, mortal, unpardonable, unjustifiable.
* * * * *
VERACITY.
Synonyms:
candor, honesty, reality, truthfulness, frankness, ingenuousness, truth, verity.
Truth is primarily and verity is always a quality of thought or speech, especially of speech, as in exact
conformity to fact. Veracity is properly a quality of a person, the habit of speaking and the disposition to
speak the truth; a habitual liar may on some occasions speak the truth, but that does not constitute him a man
of veracity; on the other hand, a person of undoubted veracity may state (through ignorance or
misinformation) what is not the truth. Truthfulness is a quality that may inhere either in a person or in his
statements or beliefs. Candor, frankness, honesty, and ingenuousness are allied with veracity, and verity with
truth, while truthfulness may accord with either. Truth in a secondary sense may be applied to intellectual
action or moral character, in the former case becoming a close synonym of veracity; as, I know him to be a
man of truth.
Antonyms:
deceit, duplicity, falsehood, fiction, lie, deception, error, falseness, guile, mendacity, delusion, fabrication,
falsity, imposture, untruth.

* * * * *
VERBAL.
Synonyms:
literal, oral, vocal.
Oral (L. os, the mouth) signifies uttered through the mouth or (in common phrase) by word of mouth; verbal
(L. verbum, a word) signifies of, pertaining to, or connected with words, especially with words as
distinguished from the ideas they convey; vocal (L. vox, the voice) signifies of or pertaining to the voice,
uttered or modulated by the voice, and especially uttered with or sounding with full, resonant voice; literal (L.
litera, a letter) signifies consisting of or expressed by letters, or according to the letter, in the broader sense of
the exact meaning or requirement of the words used; what is called "the letter of the law" is its literal meaning
without going behind what is expressed by the letters on the page. Thus oral applies to that which is given by
spoken words in distinction from that which is written or printed; as, oral tradition; an oral examination. By
this rule we should in strictness speak of an oral contract or an oral message, but verbal contract and verbal
message, as indicating that which is by spoken rather than by written words, have become so fixed in the
language that they can probably never be changed; this usage is also in line with other idioms of the language;
as, "I give you my word," "a true man's word is as good as his bond," "by word of mouth," etc. A verbal
translation may be oral or written, so that it is word for word; a literal translation follows the construction and
idiom of the original as well as the words; a literal translation is more than one that is merely verbal; both
verbal and literal are opposed to free. In the same sense, of attending to words only, we speak of verbal
criticism, a verbal change. Vocal has primary reference to the human voice; as, vocal sounds, vocal music;
vocal may be applied within certain limits to inarticulate sounds given forth by other animals than man; as, the
woods were vocal with the songs of birds; oral is never so applied, but is limited to articulate utterance
regarded as having a definite meaning; as, an oral statement.

VICTORY.
Synonyms:
achievement, conquest, success, triumph. advantage, mastery, supremacy,
Victory is the state resulting from the overcoming of an opponent or opponents in any contest, or from the
overcoming of difficulties, obstacles, evils, etc., considered as opponents or enemies. In the latter sense any
hard-won achievement, advantage, or success may be termed a victory. In conquest and mastery there is
implied a permanence of state that is not implied in victory. Triumph, originally denoting the public rejoicing
in honor of a victory, has come to signify also a peculiarly exultant, complete, and glorious victory. Compare
CONQUER.
Antonyms:
defeat, disappointment, failure, miscarriage, retreat, destruction, disaster, frustration, overthrow, rout.
* * * * *
VIGILANT.
Synonyms:
alert, cautious, on the lookout, wary, awake, circumspect, sleepless, watchful, careful, on the alert, wakeful,
wide-awake.
Vigilant implies more sustained activity and more intelligent volition than alert; one may be habitually alert
by reason of native quickness of perception and thought, or one may be momentarily alert under some
excitement or expectancy; one who is vigilant is so with thoughtful purpose. One is vigilant against danger or
harm; he may be alert or watchful for good as well as against evil; he is wary in view of suspected stratagem,
trickery, or treachery. A person may be wakeful because of some merely physical excitement or excitability,
as through insomnia; yet he may be utterly careless and negligent in his wakefulness, the reverse of watchful;
a person who is truly watchful must keep himself wakeful while on watch, in which case wakeful has
something of mental quality. Watchful, from the Saxon, and vigilant, from the Latin, are almost exact
equivalents; but vigilant has somewhat more of sharp definiteness and somewhat more suggestion of volition;
one may be habitually watchful; one is vigilant of set purpose and for direct cause, as in the presence of an
enemy. Compare ALERT.
Antonyms:
careless, heedless, inconsiderate, oblivious, drowsy, inattentive, neglectful, thoughtless, dull, incautious,
negligent, unwary.

VIRTUE.
Synonyms:
chastity, honesty, probity, truth, duty, honor, purity, uprightness, excellence, integrity, rectitude, virtuousness,
faithfulness, justice, righteousness, worth, goodness, morality, rightness, worthiness.
Virtue (L. virtus, primarily manly strength or courage, from vir, a man, a hero) is, in its full sense, goodness
that is victorious through trial, perhaps through temptation and conflict. Goodness, the being morally good,
may be much less than virtue, as lacking the strength that comes from trial and conflict, or it may be very
much more than virtue, as rising sublimely above the possibility of temptation and conflict--the infantile as
contrasted with the divine goodness. Virtue is distinctively human; we do not predicate it of God. Morality is
conformity to the moral law in action, whether in matters concerning ourselves or others, whether with or
without right principle. Honesty and probity are used especially of one's relations to his fellow men, probity
being to honesty much what virtue in some respects is to goodness; probity is honesty tried and proved,
especially in those things that are beyond the reach of legal requirement; above the commercial sense, honesty
may be applied to the highest truthfulness of the soul to and with itself and its Maker. Integrity, in the full
sense, is moral wholeness without a flaw; when used, as it often is, of contracts and dealings, it has reference
to inherent character and principle, and denotes much more than superficial or conventional honesty. Honor is
a lofty honesty that scorns fraud or wrong as base and unworthy of itself. Honor rises far above thought of the
motto that "honesty is the best policy." Purity is freedom from all admixture, especially of that which debases;
it is chastity both of heart and life, but of the life because from the heart. Duty, the rendering of what is due to
any person or in any relation, is, in this connection, the fulfilment of moral obligation. Rectitude and
righteousness denote conformity to the standard of right, whether in heart or act; righteousness is used
especially in the religious sense. Uprightness refers especially to conduct. Virtuousness is a quality of the soul
or of action; in the latter sense it is the essence of virtuous action. Compare INNOCENT; JUSTICE;

WANDER.
Synonyms:
deviate, diverge, go astray, range, rove, swerve, digress, err, ramble, roam, stray, veer.
To wander (AS. windan, wind) is to move in an indefinite or indeterminate way which may or may not be a
departure from a prescribed way; to deviate (L. de, from, and via, a way) is to turn from a prescribed or right
way, physically, mentally, or morally, usually in an unfavorable sense; to diverge (L. di, apart, and vergo,
incline, tend) is to turn from a course previously followed or that something else follows, and has no
unfavorable implication; to digress (L. di, apart, aside, and gradior, step) is used only with reference to
speaking or writing; to err is used of intellectual or moral action, and of the moral with primary reference to
the intellectual, an error being viewed as in some degree due to ignorance. Range, roam, and rove imply the
traversing of considerable, often of vast, distances of land or sea; range commonly implies a purpose; as,
cattle range for food; a hunting-dog ranges a field for game. Roam and rove are often purposeless, and always
without definite aim. To swerve or veer is to turn suddenly from a prescribed or previous course, and often but
momentarily; veer is more capricious and repetitious; the horse swerves at the flash of a sword; the wind
veers; the ship veers with the wind. To stray is to go in a somewhat purposeless way aside from the regular
path or usual limits or abode, usually with unfavorable implication; cattle stray from their pastures; an author
strays from his subject; one strays from the path of virtue. Stray is in most uses a lighter word than wander.
Ramble, in its literal use, is always a word of pleasant suggestion, but in its figurative use always somewhat
contemptuous; as, rambling talk.

WAY.
Synonyms:
alley, course, lane, path, route, avenue, driveway, pass, pathway, street, bridle-path, highroad, passage, road,
thoroughfare, channel, highway, passageway, roadway, track.
Wherever there is room for one object to pass another there is a way. A road (originally a rideway) is a
prepared way for traveling with horses or vehicles, always the latter unless the contrary is expressly stated; a
way suitable to be traversed only by foot-passengers or by animals is called a path, bridle-path, or track; as,
the roads in that country are mere bridle-paths. A road may be private; a highway or highroad is public,
highway being a specific name for a road legally set apart for the use of the public forever; a highway may be
over water as well as over land. A route is a line of travel, and may be over many roads. A street is in some
center of habitation, as a city, town, or village; when it passes between rows of dwellings the country road
becomes the village street. An avenue is a long, broad, and imposing or principal street. Track is a word of
wide signification; we speak of a goat-track on a mountain-side, a railroad-track, a race-track, the track of a
comet; on a traveled road the line worn by regular passing of hoofs and wheels in either direction is called the
track. A passage is between any two objects or lines of enclosure, a pass commonly between mountains. A
driveway is within enclosed grounds, as of a private residence. A channel is a waterway. A thoroughfare is a
way through; a road or street temporarily or permanently closed at any point ceases for such time to be a
thoroughfare. Compare AIR; DIRECTION.

WISDOM.
Synonyms:
attainment, insight, prudence, depth, judgment, reason, discernment, judiciousness, reasonableness, discretion,
knowledge, sagacity, enlightenment, learning, sense, erudition, prescience, skill, foresight, profundity,
understanding. information,
Enlightenment, erudition, information, knowledge, learning, and skill are acquired, as by study or practise.
Insight, judgment, profundity or depth, reason, sagacity, sense, and understanding are native qualities of
mind, tho capable of increase by cultivation. The other qualities are on the border-line. Wisdom has been
defined as "the right use of knowledge," or "the use of the most important means for attaining the best ends,"
wisdom thus presupposing knowledge for its very existence and exercise. Wisdom is mental power acting upon
the materials that fullest knowledge gives in the most effective way. There may be what is termed "practical
wisdom" that looks only to material results; but in its full sense, wisdom implies the highest and noblest
exercise of all the faculties of the moral nature as well as of the intellect. Prudence is a lower and more
negative form of the same virtue, respecting outward and practical matters, and largely with a view of
avoiding loss and injury; wisdom transcends prudence, so that while the part of prudence is ordinarily also
that of wisdom, cases arise, as in the exigencies of business or of war, when the highest wisdom is in the
disregard of the maxims of prudence. Judgment, the power of forming decisions, especially correct decisions,
is broader and more positive than prudence, leading one to do, as readily as to refrain from doing; but
judgment is more limited in range and less exalted in character than wisdom; to say of one that he displayed
good judgment is much less than to say that he manifested wisdom. Skill is far inferior to wisdom, consisting
largely in the practical application of acquired knowledge, power, and habitual processes, or in the ingenious
contrivance that makes such application possible. In the making of something perfectly useless there may be
great skill, but no wisdom. Compare ACUMEN; ASTUTE; KNOWLEDGE; MIND; PRUDENCE;
SAGACIOUS; SKILFUL.
Antonyms:
absurdity, folly, imbecility, miscalculation, senselessness, error, foolishness, imprudence, misjudgment,

WIT.
Synonyms:
banter, fun, joke, waggery, burlesque, humor, playfulness, waggishness, drollery, jest, pleasantry, witticism.
facetiousness, jocularity, raillery,
Wit is the quick perception of unusual or commonly unperceived analogies or relations between things
apparently unrelated, and has been said to depend upon a union of surprise and pleasure; it depends certainly
on the production of a diverting, entertaining, or merrymaking surprise. The analogies with which wit plays
are often superficial or artificial; humor deals with real analogies of an amusing or entertaining kind, or with
traits of character that are seen to have a comical side as soon as brought to view. Wit is keen, sudden, brief,
and sometimes severe; humor is deep, thoughtful, sustained, and always kindly. Pleasantry is lighter and less
vivid than wit. Fun denotes the merry results produced by wit and humor, or by any fortuitous occasion of
mirth, and is pronounced and often hilarious.
Antonyms:
dulness, seriousness, sobriety, solemnity, stolidity, stupidity. gravity,

WORK.
Synonyms:
achievement, doing, labor, product, action, drudgery, occupation, production, business, employment,
performance, toil. deed, exertion.
Work is the generic term for any continuous application of energy toward an end; work may be hard or easy.
Labor is hard and wearying work; toil is straining and exhausting work. Work is also used for any result of
working, physical or mental, and has special senses, as in mechanics, which labor and toil do not share.
Drudgery is plodding, irksome, and often menial work. Compare ACT; BUSINESS.
Antonyms:
ease, leisure, recreation, relaxation, repose, rest, vacation. idleness,
* * * * *
YET.
Synonyms:
besides, further, hitherto, now, still, thus far.
Yet and still have many closely related senses, and, with verbs of past time, are often interchangeable; we may
say "while he was yet a child," or "while he was still a child." Yet, like still, often applies to past action or state
extending to and including the present time, especially when joined with as; we can say "he is feeble as yet,"
or "he is still feeble," with scarcely appreciable difference of meaning, except that the former statement
implies somewhat more of expectation than the latter. Yet with a negative applies to completed action, often
replacing a positive statement with still; "he is not gone yet" is nearly the same as "he is here still." Yet has a
reference to the future which still does not share; "we may be successful yet" implies that success may begin
at some future time; "we may be successful still" implies that we may continue to enjoy in the future such
success as we are winning now.

YOUTHFUL.
Synonyms:
adolescent, callow, childlike, immature, puerile, boyish, childish, girlish, juvenile, young.
Boyish, childish, and girlish are used in a good sense of those to whom they properly belong, but in a bad
sense of those from whom more maturity is to be expected; childish eagerness or glee is pleasing in a child,
but unbecoming in a man; puerile in modern use is distinctly contemptuous. Juvenile and youthful are
commonly used in a favorable and kindly sense in their application to those still young; youthful in the sense
of having the characteristics of youth, hence fresh, vigorous, light-hearted, buoyant, may have a favorable
import as applied to any age, as when we say the old man still retains his youthful ardor, vigor, or hopefulness;
juvenile in such use would belittle the statement. Young is distinctively applied to those in the early stage of
life or not arrived at maturity. Compare NEW.
